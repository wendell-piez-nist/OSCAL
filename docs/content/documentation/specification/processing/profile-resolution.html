title: OSCAL Profile Resolution
description: Transforming a profile into the tailored catalog it represents
---
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These specifications describe how to render an OSCAL profile document in
    the form of an OSCAL catalog. We call this <b class="term">profile resolution</b>.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e14-head">Reading these specifications</h2><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e17-head">Terminology</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These DRAFT specifications take the form of a tag set mapping between the OSCAL
          <b class="term">profile</b> and OSCAL <b class="term">catalog</b> XML document models. The same mapping
        (transformation from source to target) can be effected using other expressions of the OSCAL
        model such as JSON or YAML object serializations. In these specifications, XML terminology
        is used, with reference to XML constructs such as <q class="q">element</q> and <q class="q">attribute</q>, with
        examples given using XML syntax: these however are for illustrative purposes only and
        normative only with respect to the semantic mapping, not the syntax as such. The XML
        orientation of the specification of this mapping is an expediency; in the longer term we
        plan specifications that are format-agnostic.<span class="revisit"> Let us know if you have an interest
          in helping to recast the specs / metaschema terminology?</span></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In these specifications there are references to <b class="term">source</b>, <b class="term">target</b>
        and <b class="term">result</b>. <b class="term">Source</b> refers sometimes to profile documents as a type
        (abstractly), and sometimes to instance profiles in operation, or elements within profiles
        (particular kinds of sources). <b class="term">Target</b> refers to the intended output of the
        transformation, that is the catalog model generally (as a document type) or, for particular
        source instances or elements, particular targets.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elements in the source format are marked in these specifications to appear distinctively as
          <code class="src">source-element</code> (for an element named <q class="q">source-element</q>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elements in the target format are marked in these specifications to appear distinctively as
          <code class="tgt">target-element</code> (for an element named <q class="q">target-element</q>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term <b class="term">result</b> refers to the actual results of transformation, as opposed to
        the intended or expected results. Conformance to these specifications requires that a
        processor's result corresponds to the target as described here, given a particular
        source.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term <b class="term">directive</b> is used in these specifications to refer to an element or
        combination of elements in source data, which is designed to effect a particular outcome in
        the target catalog. For the most part, directives are in the source profile document – for
        example, a <code class="src">set</code> element in a profile is a directive to set a parameter value in
        the target catalog.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to profiles, catalogs do not contain directives but instead, representations of
        security controls and their parts, optionally gathered in groups, on which directives are
        assumed to operate. There is one exception: the <code class="src">insert</code> element in control
        catalogs can be considered a directive that a parameter value be inserted into a particular
        location in running text (data content), when a catalog is rendered. Since these semantics
        respect catalog rendering, however, not profile resolution, they are out of scope for this
        document. For purposes of profile resolution, catalogs may be considered to be passive
        resources from which contents are replicated (copied): the operation of the profile, in
        contrast - its <q class="q">OSCAL semantics</q> as opposed to the domain-specific semantics of the
        information it handles – requires that it express what is to be done and how.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b class="term">Original order</b> refers to the order of elements and objects as given in the
        source. <b class="term">Canonical order</b> refers to the <q class="q">correct</q> order of elements or
        objects as defined by an OSCAL format such as the catalog or profile models. That is, the
        respective schemas of these models enforce order to the extent it is meaningful; where it is
        not (for example, in the ordering of properties on objects in JSON), a metaschema can
        nevertheless be referenced to provide an order.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So for example, on a JSON object, a <code class="src">links</code> object and a <code class="src">parts</code> object
        may be given as properties on an OSCAL <code class="src">control</code> object. Each of these collects a
        sequence of one or more objects of the appropriate type (links or parts). As properties in
        JSON, these collections are not ordered with respect to one another. However, for the sake
        of a complete definition in another of OSCAL's operational contexts (namely XML), the OSCAL
        catalog model stipulates that all links come before all parts. This has two consequences.
        First, lossless conversion between formats is possible, even when one or both is defective
        in some respect (as in this case, JSON's object model does not capture the order of object
        properties): the metaschema can provide the difference, enabling a compliant OSCAL processor
        to know how deterministically to emit valid XML (with respect to ordering) even from a
        property set (intrinsically unordered) JSON source. Second, it ensures that the relative
        ordering of links to parts will never be significant in the data: while the order of links
        within <code class="tgt">links</code> and the order of parts within <code class="tgt">parts</code> may be significant
        and can hence be preserved across representations, the order <q class="q">first links, then parts</q>,
        being defined by the model, becomes invariant across instances and thus insignificant.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Canonical order is important since there are occasions when, in order to produce valid
        outputs in XML, a profile resolver must resequence items. This may happen any place where
        the natural or intrinsic order resulting from splicing sequences in original order is not
        correct.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, this specification describes not only (source) profiles and (target or result)
        catalogs, but <b class="term">control selections</b> as well. The conceptual model of profile
        resolution takes a profile through several steps, in which controls are collected from
        source catalogs, combined, and potentially modified. As described by this specification,
        control selections are produced during this process, as temporary collections of controls in
        a transitional state. In the last phase of processing, the discrete selections are combined
        into the single catalog, the target.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For illustrative purposes, these control selections are, like source and target formats,
        also represented by tagging in examples given here, and described as intermediate targets,
        even though no OSCAL processor is obliged to produce or recognize such XML at any point, as
        long as it produces the same results (final outputs) from the same inputs.</p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e131-head">RFC 2119 Keywords</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="revisit">When complete, this specification will conform to IETF RFC 2119 in its use of
          keywords such as <q class="q">must</q>
          <q class="q">required</q> and <q class="q">shall</q>. At present (time of writing) an editorial pass to ensure
          this consistency has <em class="em">not</em> been conducted.</span></p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e149-head">Use of XPath</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, in these specifications XPath notation is used to identify elements and
        attributes in the XML. A summary of some lightweight XPath syntax:</p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li><p><b class="xpath">element</b> (unpunctuated) indicates an element named
            <b class="xpath">element</b></p></li><li><p><b class="xpath">@attribute</b> (punctuated <q class="q">@</q>) indicates an attribute named
              <b class="xpath">attribute</b></p></li><li><p><b class="xpath">elem/@attr</b> indicates an attribute named <b class="xpath">attr</b> on an
            element named <b class="xpath">elem</b></p></li><li><p><b class="xpath">elmn[@att='val']</b> indicates an element <b class="xpath">elmn</b> that has an
            attribute <b class="xpath">@att</b> with value <code class="code">val</code>. </p></li></ul><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e196-head">Variable contents in XML examples</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples given to illustrate targets for particular source (example) inputs are given, like
        the source, in XML notation. Sometimes, however, the expected outputs are not fully defined
        by the inputs given. In these cases, a description of the dynamic (variable) contents in
        curly braces <b class="term">{ }</b>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So for example where a property is added to target <code class="tgt">metadata</code>, an example could
        show</p>{{< highlight xml>}}<last-modified>{ timestamp }</last-modified>{{</highlight>}}<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This indicates the <code class="tgt">last-modified</code> element should be produced with contents
        generated appropriately, namely with an actual time stamp in this case, and not the string
          <q class="q">{ timestamp }</q>. In display, these values should also be shown with special
        formatting as shown here.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples also indicate unspecified content using a simple <q class="q"> … </q> (elision) character,
        typically for more verbose chunks of target data whose production is specified elsewhere in
        the document.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e227-head">Operational context</h2><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e230-head">Processing context and scope</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A <b class="term">profile</b> in OSCAL represents a selection and configuration of a set of
          <b class="term">controls</b>. In the normal case, the set of controls available to a profile is
        provided by a catalog. For example, the three NIST SP 800-53 profiles representing the
        impact baselines HIGH, MODERATE and LOW: each of these calls on a catalog representing the
        families, controls and control enhancements described in SP 800-53/53A. In a data processing
        system, this dependency can be modeled in the form of separate documents or data instances -
        the (nominal) <q class="q">catalog</q> and its <q class="q">profile</q>, the latter being a selection,
        adaptation and organization of controls, as distinct from the catalog from which those
        controls are derived.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, profiles may also select controls from profiles, thus deriving them from
        underlying catalogs as modified by those profiles. This feature enables an organization that
        wishes to promulgate guidelines or requirements to do so by publishing a set of
        customizations to an existing catalog, rather than create a catalog from scratch. Profiles
        can also arrange combinations of controls from more than one catalog or profile origin,
        making it possible to use them to support the creation of hybrid catalogs. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the general case OSCAL must support sourcing more than one catalog at once, in order to
        aggregate and organize controls from disparate sources. For example, it should be routine
        for a profile to acquire its controls from an authoritative standard catalog, plus a local
        supplement.  But multiple catalog inputs, especially when they are produced and sourced
        independently of one another, may not combine without issues. In order to provide sensible
        and transparent results even for incoherent inputs, this specification defines these
        processes such that legible and testable results are produced even when they are formally
        invalid to constraints governing the outputs. Such downstream processing errors including
        validation errors are expected to be detectable and remediable. This especially applies to
        situations where multiple catalogs are sourced, or where the same catalog is sourced more
        than once, directly or indirectly.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to support these semantics – because whatever data set is sourced by a profile, it
        must <q class="q">look like a catalog</q> – the results of resolving a single profile must be in the
        form of a single catalog. Two different OSCAL processors that promise profile resolution,
        must deliver, for the same input, the same catalog with regard to its contents: which
        controls are included; their ordering (insofar as the target format represents ordering);
        and the structure (groups) in which they are embedded. This specification is designed to
        make this possible, by defining outputs with sufficient rigor that <q class="q">the same</q> is
        meaningful and testable in this context.</p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e259-head">Why resolve a profile as a catalog</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A profile is a representation of a delta, a <q class="q">here to there</q>. As such, a profile might
        be conceived of as a recipe or instruction set – a sequence of steps or procedures – whereby
        to create an OSCAL catalog (set of controls describing security requirements) from an OSCAL
        catalog (set of controls describing security requirements). The primary use case for this is
        when we need to make a new catalog to apply to a system or set of systems, starting from a
        canonical, received, mandated or standard catalog with a more general scope.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is because although catalogs - for example, the controls described in NIST SP 800-53 -
        are published, available for use, and even standardized, they can never be used exactly in
        the form in which they are acquired. They must be taken from the packaging and placed into
        operational context before they mean anything. This typically requires that a few operations
        over <q class="q">raw catalogs</q> be supported by a profiling mechanism. We must be able to select
        controls; we must be able to arrange them in order (or not); and we must be able to qualify
        or condition them by setting parameters defined for them and making adjustments to them. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By representing the steps by which a base catalog can be sliced, sifted, amended and
        edited, into a (nominally) finished or ready set of control requirements, a profile makes it
        easier to codify and preserve even very incidental or temporary local revisions of a control
        catalog. Once expressed as a profile in OSCAL format, a set of emendations to a catalog can
        be managed entirely separately and independently from the catalog. Because a conformant
        processor can always create the customized catalog by resolving the profile against its
        sources (executing the transformation described in this document), the profile can also be
        examined and used as a proxy for that catalog for other purposes. The customized catalog can
        be made available wherever and for whatever purposes it is needed, while its revision and
        maintenance can be focused on the profile.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This separation of concerns - between the originating catalog authors, who describe policy
        in only general terms, and the authors of the <q class="q">user manual</q> catalog, who must describe
        policy in very particular and local terms - is a necessary factor in supporting sustainable
        processes with the potential for automation and process improvement. An OSCAL profile
        bridges the gap between a set of general guidelines, and actionable rules. Only by examining
        the system in the context of the actual intentions appropriate to that system, can we
        properly assess its security. Profiles make this possible.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order for this to work however we need a process that can perform the necessary
        operations, to apply the delta to an unmodified catalog, to produce the local view of the
        catalog as modified. This is profile resolution.</p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e281-head">Formal validation of source and result</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an XML context, document validation is available as a means of determining whether an
        arbitrary XML document entity conforms to structural and naming constraints such as must be
        assumed by processors respecting application semantics. These specifications assume that XML
        inputs for profile resolution will be <em class="em">schema-valid</em> with respect to the OSCAL
          <b class="term">profile</b> model, and hence will be tagged in the namespace
          <code class="code">http://csrc.nist.gov/ns/oscal/1.0</code>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, the definition of the output format or results, is constrained by the OSCAL
          <b class="term">catalog</b> model as defined by its schema.</p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e300-head">Order of objects in serialization</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As described above, <b class="term">original order</b> refers to the order of elements and objects
        as given in the source, whereas <b class="term">canonical order</b> refers to the <q class="q">correct</q>
        order of elements or objects as defined by an OSCAL format such as the catalog or profile
        models. That is, the respective schemas of these models enforce order to the extent it is
        meaningful; where it is not (for example, in the ordering of properties on objects in JSON),
        a metaschema can nevertheless be referenced to restore an order.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So for example, on a JSON object, a <code class="src">links</code> object and a <code class="src">parts</code> object
        may be given as properties on a <code class="src">control</code> object. As properties, they are not
        ordered with respect to one another. However, for the sake of a complete definition in
        another of OSCAL's operational contexts (namely XML), the catalog model stipulates that all
        links come before all parts: in an XML representation, <code class="tgt">link</code> elements come before
          <code class="tgt">part</code> elements. This restriction ensures that the relative ordering of links to
        parts will never be significant in the data: while the order of links within
          <code class="tgt">links</code> and the order of parts within <code class="tgt">parts</code> may be significant and can
        hence be preserved across representations, the order <q class="q">first links, then parts</q> is
        defined by the model, with the consequence that it can be represented as such even when an
        underlying representation (such as a compiled JSON object) does not encode that relationship
        natively.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are occasions especially when control contents are altered or amended, when a
        straightforward representation of elements in their original order, or in two sequences
        spliced together (say, the parts of a control, followed by new properties for the same
        control, added by the profile), would be invalid, which is to say not conformant with
        canonical order. In general the rule in these cases is, in resolution, to reorder the
        elements. <span class="revisit">Example</span></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For any given element (defined as an assembly in the metaschema), the canonical order is
        given by its model. So for example the canonical order for contents of a catalog is
          <code class="tgt">metadata</code>, <code class="tgt">param</code>, <code class="tgt">control</code>, <code class="tgt">group</code>,
          <code class="tgt">back-matter</code>. Within this sequence, members may be missing, as for example not
        all catalogs will have parameters or groups. Any members that are present, however, must be
        given in this order.</p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e362-head">ID uniqueness constraint</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to those described and enforced by the respective schemas, there are additional
        constraints over the data that this process relies on. The most important of these is
        ID-distinctiveness. Every <code class="src">id</code> flag (in XML, represented by <b class="xpath">@id</b>
        attributes) on an element in the model, whether it be attached to a control, group or an
        element within a control, must be distinct and unique, within the defined processing scope,
        inasmuch as this value will be used in processing as a proxy for <b class="term">element
          identity</b> and especially (in the case of controls) for <b class="term">control
        identity</b>. That is, it is on the basis of their IDs that controls are selected and
        referenced, and clashes are detected and recognized between competing representations of
        controls.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this context, <q class="q">defined processing scope</q> includes a profile along with all profiles
        and all catalogs it imports, directly and indirectly. Many arrangements are possible in
        which a single catalog provides controls to more than a single branch on the import tree. In
        profiles where this occurs, distinct imports must identify discrete, non-intersecting, sets
        of controls, or clashes occur. Additionally, clashes may naturally occur through implicit
        copying of parameters from multiple imports.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">OSCAL profiles provide three different modes for handling clashing controls or replicas in
        general, where <b class="term">replica</b> refers to any element represented more than once. Each
        of these modes is indicated by different directives given on <code class="src">merge/@combine</code>,
        namely <q class="q">keep</q> (also the default), <q class="q">use-first</q> and <q class="q">merge</q>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="revisit">Because ID distinctiveness within the scope of processing, is critical, OSCAL
          users should take care that different catalogs have distinct sets of IDs. This applies to
          all structures within the catalogs, not only controls but also groups, parameters,
          citations and resources.</span></p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e404-head">Defining control identity</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A central problem in profile resolution is determining when two controls are both
        representations of <q class="q">the same</q> control, even when those representations have dissimilar
        contents or come to a profile through different import pathways.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For purposes of profile resolution, control identity (or parameter, group identity etc.)
        can be determined by any of several ways, depending on the <b class="term">identity designation
          mode</b>:</p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li><p>strict - control ID only - ordinary mode for well-controlled inputs</p></li><li><p>diagnostic - control ID + provenance identifier</p></li><li><p>maintenance - control ID + provenance + class (version etc)</p></li><li><p>none - no identification (each input control is distinct) - for tracing</p></li></ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="revisit">Brian Ruf suggested we provide a resolution/disambiguation/debugging mode that
          produces valid OSCAL by producing new IDs for everything, thereby disambiguating by brute
          force. This is not a bad idea. This proposal offers that feature as 'no identity
          designation', i.e. nothing is found to be identical with anything.</span></p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e434-head">Detecting issues in profiles</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is frequently possible by static analysis to detect many conditions even in schema-valid
        profile documents, that will result in problematic catalogs in resolution. The most common
        issue will be clashing controls, that is more than one control in underlying catalogs with a
        given identifier (ID), making references to such controls ambiguous. The <b class="term">identity
          designation mode</b> is intended to give profile developers some control over this
        handling, for purposes of development or diagnosis; but the quality of the results can only
        be guaranteed determinatively by the quality of the inputs, and full analysis in support of
        profile development and diagnostics – to produce correct inputs that accurately reflect the
        intent – is outside the scope of these specifications.</p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e442-head">Comments in result documents</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an XML-based profile resolution, XML comments are one straightforward way for a
        processor to record events or conditions without affecting the output's nominal semantics.
        To support this, while two processors are obliged to return the same catalog XML for the
        same profile XML inputs, they are not required to match one another's comments, whitespace
        usage, attribute order, or processing instructions, only each other's elements, attributes
        and data content.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One consequence of this is that processes intended to compare two profile resolutions may

        may be referenced from inside its containing document by <code class="code">&lt;link
          href="#document-X"&gt;</code> appearing elsewhere. Whether an element inside back matter must
        be included in the target, depends on whether such a cross-reference has also been included
        in the same target.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specifically, any <code class="src">citation</code> or <code class="src">resource</code> inside <code class="src">back-matter</code>
        either in the profile, or in any imported catalog, is considered eligible for propagation
        into the target if either of two conditions obtains:</p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li><p>The element (<code class="src">citation</code> or <code class="src">resource</code>) is referenced by any element

            element) inside controls, parameters, or any contents (for example, paragraphs inside
              <code class="tgt">group/part</code>) included in the resolved profile. The link takes the form of a
            URI fragment identifier <code class="code">#id</code>, where <code class="code">id</code> is the value of the

        in the same order as given in their sources.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, combination rules (see next section) will affect whether and how duplicate or
        competing <code class="src">citation</code> or <code class="src">resource</code> elements are handled, to remove or
        combine multiple occurrences of the same referenced object.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="d2e926-head">Phases of profile resolution</h2><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considered as a <q class="q">document</q> or integrated data set (object), a profile has three
      sections, each of which corresponds to a conceptual step in resolution. To resolve a catalog
      fully is to perform all these steps.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the steps are described in this specification as occurring in sequence, a profile
      processor is not obliged to perform them in the order described. Conformance to these
      specifications is determined by whether the results of processing (<b class="term">resolution</b>)
      appear as described, not on whether the means to produce those results work in exactly the
      manner described here.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three steps are <code class="src">import</code> (control <b class="term">selection</b>); <code class="src">merge</code>; and
        <code class="src">modify</code>. In brief:</p><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li><p><code class="src">import</code> identifies one or more control sources (catalogs or profiles) and the
          controls within them to be included in this (resolved) profile;</p></li><li><p><code class="src">merge</code> designates the rules for how controls will be organized and merged (or
          not) in the result catalog;</p></li><li><p><code class="src">modify</code> indicates how parameters in the underlying catalog may be modified or
          set, and how control contents may be amended or modified.</p></li></ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <b class="term">selection</b> phase provides the basis for a customized catalog by designating
      controls to be included in it; a profile that designates no controls, produces no catalog. The
      selection phase is controlled by <code class="src">profile/import</code> directives in the source
      profile.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <b class="term">merge</b> phase addresses two questions: what a processor should produce in
      cases of (accidental or intentional) ambiguities in control identification in the selection
      phase; and how to structure the outputs, whether in a hierarchy (copied or created) or flat
      (without grouping). These two aspects of resolution are addressed by the <b class="term">combination
        rule</b> (or <b class="term">combination method</b>) and the <b class="term">merge rule</b> (which
      includes a <q class="q">no merge option</q>). In source data (a valid profile document), a
        <code class="src">profile/merge</code> directive is optional; when it or its child directives are absent,
      default combination and merge rules apply.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <b class="term">modification</b> phase is an opportunity for a profile to amend, alter or edit
      controls, and to set parameter values or constrain or qualify parameters as represented in the
      target. A profile can be valid and useful without making any modifications, only selections,
      so the <code class="src">profile/modify</code> element (node) is optional in the profile model.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As described in the previous section, when resolved, an OSCAL profile takes the form of an
      OSCAL catalog. The merge semantics described below will produce outputs conforming to this

        catalogs it references may be available as static resources, or they may be produced
        dynamically on request; accordingly a profile may also import profiles, to be resolved as
        catalogs, instead of or in addition to catalogs as such. Imports are given in sequence after
        the metadata:</p>{{< highlight xml>}}<profile>

          (especially profiles under development), multiple copies – and with variations – may be
          invoked from different sources. For example, if a profile tailors another profile which
          includes a control with amendments, and then (the top-level profile) includes the same
          control directly from its original catalog, a collision will occur between these two

      without modification. A truly <q class="q">null</q> profile – that is, with only an import and nothing
      else – does not return its imported catalog unchanged. But the changes it makes can be useful.
      This makes a null profile or its <b class="term">near-null</b> variants, as described in this
      section, potentially useful for catalog management, design and use, as described in this
