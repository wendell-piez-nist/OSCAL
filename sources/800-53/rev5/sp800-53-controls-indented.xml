            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the AC family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>System account types include, for example, individual, shared, group,
                system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and
                service. The identification of authorized users of the system and the specification
                of access privileges reflects the requirements in other controls in the security
                plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive
                additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel responsible for
                approving such accounts and privileged access, including, for example, system owner,
                mission/business owner, or chief information security officer. Organizations may
                choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of
                account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access
                include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin.
                In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related
                requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors
                could affect system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for
                short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal
                account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without
                the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency
                accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account
                activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account
                authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused
                with infrequently used accounts including, for example, local logon accounts used
                for special tasks or when network resources are unavailable. Such accounts remain
                available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions
                for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example, when shared/group,
                emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or when individuals are
                transferred or terminated. Some types of system accounts may require specialized
                training.</description>

                    <description>Implement the following dynamic privilege management capabilities:
                        [Assignment: organization-defined list of dynamic privilege management
                        capabilities].</description>
                </statement>
                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ
                        static system accounts and predefined user privileges, dynamic access
                        control approaches rely on run time access control decisions facilitated by
                        dynamic privilege management such as attribute based access control (ABAC).
                        While user identities remain relatively constant over time, user privileges
                        typically change more frequently based on ongoing mission or business
                        requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege
                        management can include, for example, immediate revocation of privileges from
                        users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their
                        sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management
                        can also include those mechanisms that change user privileges based on
                        dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. Examples include
                        automatic adjustments of user privileges if they are operating out of their
                        normal work times, their job function or assignment changes, or if systems
                        are under duress or in emergency situations. This control enhancement also
                        includes the effects of privilege changes, for example, the changes to
                        encryption keys used for communications.</description>

                    <description>Mandatory access control is a type of nondiscretionary access
                        control. The above class of mandatory access control policies constrains
                        what actions subjects can take with information obtained from data objects
                        for which they have already been granted access. This prevents the subjects
                        from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This
                        class of mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions
                        subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control
                        privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege
                        to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and
                        objects to which the system has control. Otherwise, the access control
                        policy can be circumvented. This enforcement is provided by an
                        implementation that meets the reference monitor concept as described in
                        AC-25. The policy is bounded by the system boundary (i.e., once the
                        information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional means
                        may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in
                        effect). The trusted subjects described above are granted privileges
                        consistent with the concept of least privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects
                        are only given the minimum privileges relative to the above policy necessary
                        for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is most
                        applicable when there is a policy mandate that establishes a policy
                        regarding access to controlled unclassified information or classified
                        information and some users of the system are not authorized access to all
                        such information resident in the system. This control can operate in
                        conjunction with AC-3(4). A subject constrained in its operation by policies
                        governed by this control is still able to operate under the less rigorous
                        constraints of AC-3(4), but policies governed by this control take
                        precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3(4). For example, while
                        a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject
                        from passing information to another subject operating at a different
                        sensitivity label, AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to
                        any subject with the same sensitivity label as the subject.</description>

                    <description>When discretionary access control policies are implemented,
                        subjects are not constrained regarding what actions they can take with
                        information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects
                        that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing
                        (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other
                        subjects or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction
                        with AC-3(3). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies
                        governed by AC-3(3) is still able to operate under the less rigorous
                        constraints of this control enhancement. Therefore, while AC-3(3) imposes
                        constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject
                        operating at a different sensitivity level, AC-3(4) permits the subject to
                        pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The
                        policy is bounded by the system boundary. Once the information is passed
                        outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to
                        help ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more
                        traditional definitions of discretionary access control require
                        identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use
                        of discretionary access control.</description>

                    <description>Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that
                        restricts system access to authorized users. Organizations can create
                        specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e.,
                        privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with the
                        organization-defined roles. When users are assigned to the organizational
                        roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those
                        roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because
                        privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a
                        significant number of individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but
                        are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be implemented
                        either as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For
                        organizations implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the
                        requirements in AC-3(3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered
                        by the policy.</description>

                    <description>Revocation of access rules may differ based on the types of access
                        revoked. For example, if a subject (i.e., user or process) is removed from a
                        group, access may not be revoked until the next time the object is opened or
                        the next time the subject attempts a new access to the object. Revocation
                        based on changes to security labels may take effect immediately.
                        Organizations provide alternative approaches on how to make revocations
                        immediate if systems cannot provide such capability and immediate revocation
                        is necessary.</description>

                    <description>Systems can only protect organizational information within the
                        confines of established system boundaries. Additional security controls may
                        be needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is
                        passed beyond the established system boundaries. In situations where the
                        system is unable to determine the adequacy of the protections provided by
                        entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations
                        determine procedurally whether the external systems are providing adequate
                        security. The means used to determine the adequacy of security provided by
                        external systems include, for example, conducting inspections or periodic
                        testing and assessments; establishing agreements between the organization
                        and its counterpart organizations; or some other process. The means used by
                        external entities to protect the information received need not be the same
                        as those used by the organization, but the means employed are sufficient to
                        provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to protect the
                        information. This control enhancement requires systems to employ technical
                        or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it to
                        external systems. For example, if the system passes information to another
                        system controlled by another organization, technical means are employed to
                        validate that the security attributes associated with the exported
                        information are appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the
                        system passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space,
                        procedural means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately
                        authorized individuals gain access to the printer. This control enhancement
                        is most applicable when there is some policy mandate that establishes policy
                        regarding access to the information, and that policy applies beyond the
                        realm of a particular system or organization.</description>

                    <description>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an access control policy
                        that restricts system access to authorized users based on their
                        organizational attributes, such as job function; environmental attributes,
                        such as time of day; and resource attributes, such as the classification of
                        a document. Organizations can create specific rules based on attributes and
                        the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on the
                        systems associated with the organization-defined attributes and rules. When
                        users are assigned to attributes defined in ABAC policies or rules, they can
                        be provisioned to a system with appropriate privileges or dynamically
                        granted access to a protected resource upon access. ABAC can be implemented
                        either as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For
                        organizations implementing ABAC with mandatory access controls, the

        <statement>
            <description>Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information
                within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment:
                organization-defined information flow control policies].</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a
                system and between systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information)
                and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control
                restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being
                transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be
                from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not
                from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between
                organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between
                systems in different security domains with different security policies introduces
                risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such
                situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy
                enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating
                specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security
                policies. Enforcement includes, for example, prohibiting information transfers
                between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); employing hardware
                mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and implementing trustworthy
                regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.
                Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement
                mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and
                destinations within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is
                based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path.
                Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule
                sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a
                packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering
                capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness
                of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software
                components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements
                3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more
                advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement
                mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards.
                Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf
                information technology products.</description>

                        encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow
                        policies. For example, an information object labeled Secret would be allowed
                        to flow to a destination object labeled Secret, but an information object
                        labeled Top Secret would not be allowed to flow to a destination object
                        labeled Secret. Security attributes can also include, for example, source
                        and destination addresses employed in traffic filter firewalls. Flow
                        enforcement using explicit security attributes can be used, for example, to
                        control the release of certain types of information.</description>

                    <description>Metadata is information used to describe the characteristics of

                    <description>Organization-defined security policy filters can address data
                        structures and content. For example, security policy filters for data
                        structures can check for maximum file lengths, maximum field sizes, and
                        data/file types (for structured and unstructured data). Security policy
                        filters for data content can check for specific words enumerated values or
                        data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits the
                        interpretation of data content by applications. Unstructured data refers to
                        digital information without a data structure or with a data structure that
                        does not facilitate the development of rule sets to address the sensitivity
                        of the information conveyed by the data or the flow enforcement decisions.
                        Unstructured data consists of bitmap objects that are inherently
                        non-language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and textual objects
                        that are based on written or printed languages. Organizations can implement
                        more than one security policy filter to meet information flow control

            <description>Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized
                privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.
                Separation of duties includes, for example, dividing mission functions and system
                support functions among different individuals and/or roles; conducting system
                support functions with different individuals; and ensuring security personnel
                administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions.
                Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains,
                organizations consider the entirety of organizational systems and system components
                when developing policy on separation of duties.</description>

            <description>This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or
                network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts
                initiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a
                predetermined time established by organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected,
                organizations may employ different algorithms for different components of the system
                based on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon
                attempts may be implemented at both the operating system and the application
                levels.</description>

            <description>System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning
                banners displayed before individuals log in to systems. System use notifications are
                used only for access via logon interfaces with human users. Such notifications are
                not required when human interfaces do not exist. Based on an assessment of risk,
                organizations consider whether or not a secondary system use notification is needed
                to access applications or other system resources after the initial network logon.
                Organizations consider system use notification messages or banners displayed in
                multiple languages based on organizational needs and the demographics of system
                users. Organizations also consult with the Office of the General Counsel for legal

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent logical access to
                organizational systems when users stop work and move away from the immediate
                vicinity of those systems but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature
                of their absences. Device locks are implemented where session activities can be
                determined. This is typically at the operating system level, but can also be at the
                application level. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of
                systems, for example, if organizations require users to log out at the end of
                workdays.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions
                in contrast to SC-10 which addresses the termination of network connections that are
                associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical
                session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or
                process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system. Such user
                sessions can be terminated without terminating network sessions. Session termination
                terminates all processes associated with a users logical session except those
                processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to
                continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events requiring
                automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods
                of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, time-of-day

            <description>This control addresses situations in which organizations determine that no
                identification or authentication is required in organizational systems.
                Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or
                authentication including, for example, when individuals access public websites or
                other publicly accessible federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to
                receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations also identify actions
                that normally require identification or authentication but may under certain
                circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed.
                Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that
                commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or
                unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and
                authentication have already occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations
                where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may
                decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational
                systems without identification and authentication and therefore, the values for
                assignment statements can be none.</description>

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions
                known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of
                entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are
                typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of
                individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with
                data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and
                communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions
                representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities
                with respect to safeguarding information. Privacy attributes, which may be used
                independently, or in conjunction with security attributes, represent the basic
                properties or characteristics of an entity with respect to the management of
                personally identifiable information. Such attributes are used to enable the
                implementation of the need for the record in the performance of duties, the
                identification of personal information within data objects, and the identification
                of permitted uses of personal information. Attributes can be explicitly or
                implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational systems or
                system components. Security and privacy attributes may be associated with active
                entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information, to
                cause information to flow among objects, or to change the system state. These
                attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain
                or receive information. The association of security and privacy attributes to
                subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is inclusive of setting the
                attribute value and the attribute type. Security and privacy attributes when bound
                to data or information, enable the enforcement of security policies for access
                control and information flow control and privacy policies including, for example,
                for data retention limits and permitted uses of personally identifiable information.
                Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions or
                mechanisms. Binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength of
                attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with
                binding techniques play an important part in the trust organizations have in the
                information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and
                degree of additional reviews required by organizations. The content or assigned
                values of the security and privacy attributes can directly affect the ability of
                individuals to access organizational information. Organizations can define the types
                of attributes needed for selected systems to support missions or business functions.
                There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given
                security attribute. Release markings can include, for example, US only, NATO, or
                NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute
                ranges and values, organizations ensure that the security and privacy attribute
                values are meaningful and relevant. Labeling refers to the association of security
                and privacy attributes with subjects and objects represented by the internal data
                structures within organizational systems. This facilitates system-based enforcement
                of information security and privacy policies. Labels include, for example, access
                authorizations, nationality, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data
                expiration), data subject consents, permissible data uses, affiliation as
                contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and
                compliance requirements. Conversely, marking refers to the association of security

            <description>Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on
                behalf of users) communicating through external networks such as the Internet.
                Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.
                Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance
                confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs
                provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such
                connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are
                implemented in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
                regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse
                external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote
                connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the capability to
                adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access
                controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for
                public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access
                without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations
                may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections,
                such agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for
                remote connections is addressed in AC-3.</description>

                        unauthorized use of wireless communications outside of

                        of wireless transmissions so that the transmissions are less likely to emit
                        a signal that can be captured outside of the physical perimeters of the
                        organization; employing measures such as emissions security to control
                        wireless emanations; and using directional or beam forming antennas that
                        reduce the likelihood that unintended receivers will be able to intercept
                        signals. Prior to taking such mitigating actions, organizations can conduct
                        periodic wireless surveys to understand the radio frequency profile of

            <description>A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such
                that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without
                a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and
                includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include
                voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture
                information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote
                locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are
                typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually near the
                individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form
                factor and size of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability
                of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop
                systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Controlled
                areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient physical or
                procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting
                information and systems. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different
                characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the
                different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific
                implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration
                management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory
                protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection
                software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary
                operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and
                disabling unnecessary hardware. Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may
                vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the
                connection of mobile devices to the organizational network and impose a set of usage
                restrictions while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device
                connection to specific applications or may impose additional usage restrictions
                before allowing mobile device connections to a system. The need to provide adequate
                security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many
                safeguards for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls allocated to
                the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security
                plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some overlap by
                the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses
                mobile devices that are not organization-controlled.</description>

        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>External systems are systems or components of systems that are outside of
                the authorization boundary established by organizations and for which organizations
                typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of required
                security controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems
                include, for example, personally owned systems, components, or devices; privately
                owned computing and communications devices in commercial or public facilities;
                systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; and federal systems that
                are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of the
                organization. This includes systems managed by contractors, systems owned by other
                federal agencies, and systems owned by other organizations within the same agency.
                This control addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or
                transmission of organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud
                services from organizational systems. For some external systems (i.e., systems
                operated by other federal agencies and organizations subordinate to those agencies),
                the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and
                the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are
                required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external. These
                situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing and trust
                agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or
                organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are
                specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, or
                policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel,
                contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems
                and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior
                with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized
                individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending on the
                trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to
                impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or
                tribal governments. This control does not apply to external systems used to access
                public interfaces to organizational systems. Organizations establish specific terms
                and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational
                security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: the
                specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from
                external systems; and the highest security category of information that can be
                processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions
                with the owners of external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose
                restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.</description>

                        compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification
                        that the required security controls have been implemented can be achieved,
                        for example, by external, independent assessments, attestations, or other

                        systems or system components owned by other organizations and personally

                        systems or system components. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently high
                        as to prohibit such use. In other cases, the use of such systems or system
                        components may be allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include,
                        for example, requiring the implementation of approved security and privacy
                        controls prior to authorizing the connection of non-organizationally owned
                        systems and components; limiting access to certain types of information,
                        services, or applications; using virtualization techniques to limit

                    <description>In distributed systems, authorization processes and access control
                        decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such instances,
                        authorization information is transmitted securely so timely access control
                        decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To support the
                        access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the
                        access authorization information, supporting security attributes. This is
                        because in distributed systems, there are various access control decisions
                        that need to be made and different entities make these decisions in a serial
                        fashion, each requiring security attributes to make the decisions.
                        Protecting access authorization information ensures that such information

                        and, especially in the case of distributed systems, transmitting such

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions
                known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of
                entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are
                associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals.
                Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data
                structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and
                communications ports. Reference monitors enforce mandatory access control policies,
                a type of access control that restricts access to objects based on the identity of
                subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The access controls are mandatory
                because subjects with certain privileges (i.e., access permissions) are restricted
                from passing those privileges on to any other subjects, either directly or
                indirectlythat is, the system strictly enforces the access control policy based on
                the rule set established by the policy. The tamperproof property of the reference
                monitor prevents adversaries from compromising the functioning of the mechanism. The
                always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and hence
                violating the security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the
                completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect weaknesses or
                deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security
                policy.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the AT family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>Organizations determine the content of security and privacy awareness
                training and security and privacy awareness techniques based on the specific
                organizational requirements and the systems to which personnel have authorized
                access. The content includes an understanding of the need for information security
                and privacy and actions by users to maintain security and privacy and to respond to
                suspected security and privacy incidents. The content also addresses an awareness of
                the need for operations security. Security and privacy awareness techniques can
                include, for example, displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security
                and privacy reminders, generating email advisories/notices from senior
                organizational officials, displaying logon screen messages, and conducting
                information security and privacy awareness events. Awareness training after the
                initial training (i.e., described AT-2c) is conducted at a minimum frequency
                consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Such
                training may be satisfied by one or more short ad hoc sessions and include topical
                information on recent attack schemes, changes to organizational security and privacy
                policies, revised security and privacy expectations, and/or a subset of topics from
                the initial training.</description>

                    <description>Social engineering is an attempt to trick someone into revealing
                        information or taking an action that can be used to attack or compromise

                        baiting, quid pro quo, and tailgaiting. Social mining is an attempt, in a
                        social setting, to gather information about the organization that may
                        support future attacks. Security and privacy awareness training includes
                        information on how to communicate concerns of employees and management
                        regarding potential and actual instances of social engineering and mining

            <description>Organizations determine the appropriate content of security and privacy
                training based on the assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the
                specific security and privacy requirements of organizations and the systems to which
                personnel have authorized access, including security-related technical training
                specifically tailored for assigned duties. Roles that may require role-based
                security and privacy training include, for example, system owners; authorizing
                officials; system security officers; privacy officers; enterprise architects;
                acquisition and procurement officials; systems engineers; system and software
                developers; system, network, and database administrators; personnel conducting
                configuration management activities; personnel performing verification and
                validation activities; auditors; personnel having access to system-level software;
                security and privacy control assessors; personnel with contingency planning and
                incident response duties; personnel with privacy management responsibilities; and
                personnel having access to personally identifiable information. Comprehensive
                role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and
                responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical safeguards and
                countermeasures. Such training can include, for example, policies, procedures,
                tools, methods, and artifacts for the security and privacy roles defined.
                Organizations provide the training necessary for individuals to fulfill their
                responsibilities related to operations and supply chain security within the context
                of organizational information security and privacy programs. Role-based security and

                    <description>A well-trained workforce provides another organizational safeguard
                        that can be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect
                        organizations against malicious code coming in to organizations via email or
                        the web applications. Personnel are trained to look for indications of
                        potentially suspicious email for example, receiving an unexpected email,
                        receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email
                        from an unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor or
                        contractor. Personnel are also trained on how to respond to suspicious email
                        or web communications. For this process to work effectively, organizational
                        personnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes suspicious
                        communications. Training personnel on how to recognize anomalous behaviors
                        in organizational systems can potentially provide early warning for the
                        presence of malicious code. Recognition of such anomalous behavior by
                        organizational personnel can supplement automated malicious code detection
                        and protection tools and systems employed by organizations.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the AU family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational system.
                Organizations identify audit event types as those events which are significant and
                relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those systems
                operate to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit event types can include, for
                example, password changes; failed logons or failed accesses related to systems;
                security attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage,
                query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of auditable
                event types, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the
                security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other
                system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable event
                types that are audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may
                determine that systems must have the capability to log every file access both
                successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific
                circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing
                requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other
                security and privacy controls and control enhancements for example, AC-2(4),
                AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-16(11), AC-17(1), CM-3.f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1),
                MP-4(2), PA-4.d, PE-3, PM-22, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22), SI-7(8),
                and SI-10(1). Organizations also include auditable event types that are required by
                applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
                guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels, including at the
                packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level
                of auditing is an important aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the
                identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition
                of auditable event types, the auditing necessary to cover related event types such
                as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes and actions that occur in
                service-oriented architectures.</description>

                        account users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit
                        information to only that information explicitly needed for specific audit
                        requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs by not

                        importance of ensuring mission and business continuity, organizations may
                        determine that the nature of the audit failure is not so severe that it
                        warrants a complete shutdown of the system supporting the core
                        organizational missions and business operations. In those instances, partial
                        system shutdowns or operating in a degraded mode with reduced capability may
                        be viable alternatives.</description>

            <description>Audit review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related
                auditing performed by organizations including, for example, auditing that results
                from monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile
                device connection, configuration settings, system component inventory, use of
                maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance, physical access, temperature and
                humidity, equipment delivery and removal, communications at system boundaries, and
                use of mobile code or VoIP. Findings can be reported to organizational entities that
                include, for example, the incident response team, help desk, information security
                group/department. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit
                information or unable to conduct such activities, the review/analysis may be carried
                out by other organizations granted such authority. The frequency, scope, and/or
                depth of the audit review, analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to meet
                organizational needs based on new information received.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning,
                        the generation of performance data, or system monitoring. Rather, the
                        enhancement requires that the analysis of information being otherwise
                        produced in these areas is integrated with the analysis of audit
                        information. Security Event and Information Management System tools can
                        facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple system
                        components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of
                        standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with
                        localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective
                        approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation
                        of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is
                        important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating
                        attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance
                        data can uncover denial of service attacks or other types of attacks
                        resulting in unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system
                        monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better
                        relating audit information to operational situations.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources records

                        harassment incidents and improper use of organizational information assets.
                        Such information can lead to a more directed analytical effort to detect
                        potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive nature of the
                        information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access
                        to such information to minimize the potential for the inadvertent release of
                        privacy-related information to individuals that do not have a need to know.
                        Thus, correlation of information from nontechnical sources with audit
                        information generally occurs only when individuals are suspected of being
                        involved in a security incident. Organizations obtain legal advice prior to

            <description>Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information
                and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to
                analysts. Audit reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate
                from the same system or from the same organizational entities conducting auditing
                activities. Audit reduction capability can include, for example, modern data mining
                techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit
                records. The report generation capability provided by the system can generate
                customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if
                the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient.</description>

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Time stamps generated by the system include date and time. Time is commonly
                expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich
                Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time
                measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and
                reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds
                or tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for
                different system components. Time service can also be critical to other security
                capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending
                on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.</description>

                not having received messages; and individual signatories of not having signed
                documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information
                originated from a certain individual, or if an individual took specific actions, for
                example, sending an email, signing a contract, or approving a procurement request,
                or received specific information. Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by
                employing various techniques or mechanisms including, for example, digital
                signatures and digital message receipts.</description>

                Organizations develop standard categories of audit records relative to such types of
                actions and standard response processes for each type of action. The National
                Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules provide federal

                        Organizations can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are
                        changed, for example, near real-time, within minutes, or within
                        hours.</description>

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>When organizations use systems and/or services of external organizations,
                the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach across organizations.
                For example, maintaining the identity of individuals that requested specific
                services across organizational boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so
                may prove to have significant performance and privacy ramifications. Therefore, it
                is often the case that cross-organizational auditing simply captures the identity of
                individuals issuing requests at the initial system, and subsequent systems record
                that the requests emanated from authorized individuals.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the CA family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>Organizations assess security and privacy controls in organizational
                systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of initial and
                ongoing authorizations; FISMA annual assessments; continuous monitoring; and system
                development life cycle activities. Assessments ensure that organizations meet
                information security and privacy requirements; identify weaknesses and deficiencies
                in the development process; provide essential information needed to make risk-based
                decisions as part of authorization processes; and ensure compliance to vulnerability
                mitigation procedures. Organizations conduct assessments on the implemented controls
                from Chapter Three as documented in security plans and privacy plans. Organizations
                can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and
                system monitoring to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during the
                entire life cycle. Assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient
                detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and
                completeness of the reports and whether the controls are implemented correctly,
                operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting
                requirements. Assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles
                appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments
                conducted in support of authorization decisions are provided to authorizing
                officials, senior agency officials for privacy, and/or authorizing official
                designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations
                can use assessment results from the following sources: initial or ongoing system
                authorizations; continuous monitoring; or system development life cycle activities.
                Organizations ensure that assessment results are current, relevant to the
                determination of control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of
                assessor independence. Existing control assessment results can be reused to the
                extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional
                assessments as needed. After the initial authorizations, organizations assess
                controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations also establish the frequency
                for ongoing assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring
                strategies. External audits including, for example, audits by external entities such
                as regulatory agencies, are outside the scope of this control.</description>

                    <description>Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to conduct
                        security and privacy control assessments.</description>
                </statement>
                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups
                        conducting impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality implies that
                        assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest
                        regarding development, operation, sustainment, or management of the systems
                        under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve
                        impartiality, assessors should not create a mutual or conflicting interest
                        with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; assess
                        their own work; act as management or employees of the organizations they are
                        serving; or place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations
                        acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be obtained from
                        elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private
                        sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine
                        the required level of independence based on the security categories of
                        systems and/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets,
                        or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of
                        assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are
                        sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes
                        determining whether contracted assessment services have sufficient
                        independence, for example, when system owners are not directly involved in
                        contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of assessors
                        conducting assessments. When organizations that own the systems are small or
                        organizational structures require that assessments are conducted by
                        individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain
                        of system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved by
                        ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by
                        independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy,
                        integrity, and reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that
                        assessments performed for purposes other than direct support to
                        authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient
                        independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing
                        the need to repeat assessments.</description>

                        assessments can improve readiness by exercising organizational capabilities
                        and indicating current performance levels as a means of focusing actions to
                        improve security and privacy. Organizations conduct these types of

                        Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.
                        Authorizing officials approve the assessment methods in coordination with
                        the organizational risk executive function. Organizations can incorporate

                    <description>Organizations may rely on security and privacy control assessments
                        of organizational systems by other (external) organizations. Using such
                        assessments and reusing existing assessment evidence can significantly
                        decrease the time and resources required for assessments by limiting the
                        amount of independent assessment activities that organizations need to
                        perform. The factors that organizations consider in determining whether to
                        accept assessment results from external organizations can vary. Such factors
                        include, for example, past assessment experiences the organization has had
                        with the organization conducting the assessment; the reputation that the
                        assessing organization has with regard to assessments; the level of detail
                        of supporting assessment evidence provided; and the mandates imposed by

            <description>This control applies to dedicated connections between two or more separate
                systems and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such as email
                and website browsing. Organizations consider the risks that may be introduced when
                systems are connected to other systems with different security and privacy
                requirements and controls, including systems within the same organization and
                systems external to the organization. Authorizing officials determine the risk
                associated with system connections and the appropriate controls employed. If
                interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, organizations do not
                need to develop Interconnection Security Agreements. Instead, those organizations
                can describe the interface characteristics between the interconnecting systems in
                their respective security and privacy plans. If interconnecting systems have
                different authorizing officials within the same organization, the organizations can
                develop Interconnection Security Agreements or they can describe the interface
                characteristics between the systems in the security and privacy plans for the
                respective systems. Organizations may also incorporate Interconnection Security
                Agreement information into formal contracts, especially for interconnections
                established between federal agencies and nonfederal organizations. Risk
                considerations also include systems sharing the same networks. As part of the risk
                assessment of connecting to external systems, organizations consider the number and
                types of transitive connections that exist when establishing such
                connections.</description>

            <description>Authorizations are official management decisions by senior officials to
                authorize operation of systems (including the controls inherited by those systems)
                and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets,
                individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of
                agreed-upon security and privacy controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary
                oversight for organizational systems or assume responsibility for the mission and
                business operations supported by those systems. The authorization process is a
                federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal
                employees. Authorizing officials are responsible and accountable for security and
                privacy risks associated with the operation and use of organizational systems.
                Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes to authorize their systems and
                senior officials that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities.
                Organizations conduct ongoing authorizations of systems by implementing continuous
                monitoring programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs reduce the need for
                separate reauthorization processes. Through the employment of comprehensive
                continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization
                packages including the security and privacy plans, security and privacy assessment
                reports, and plans of action and milestones, is updated on an ongoing basis. This
                provides authorizing officials, system owners, and common control providers with an
                up-to-date status of the security and privacy state of their systems, controls, and
                environments of operation. To reduce the cost of reauthorization, authorizing
                officials use the results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent
                possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.</description>

                        the system authorization process. Employing authorizing officials from
                        external organizations to supplement the authorization official from the
                        organization owning or hosting the system may be necessary when those
                        organizations have a vested interest or equities in the outcome of the

                        systems, shared systems, and systems with one or more information owners.
                        Accordingly, the authorizing officials from the external organizations may

            <description>Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats,
                vulnerabilities, and information security and privacy to support organizational risk
                management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations
                assess security and privacy controls and associated risks at a frequency sufficient
                to support risk-based decisions. The results of continuous monitoring generate risk
                response actions by organizations. When monitoring the effectiveness of controls
                that have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause analysis may be needed to
                determine the specific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring programs also
                allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls
                over time in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and
                business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to
                security- and privacy-related information on a continuing basis through reports and
                dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and
                timely risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization decisions.
                Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and firmware
                inventories, authorization packages, and other system information. Effectiveness is
                further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide
                information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely.
                Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security
                categories of systems.</description>

                    <description>Organizations can maximize the value of control assessments during
                        the continuous monitoring process by requiring that assessments be conducted
                        by assessors with appropriate levels of independence. The level of assessor
                        independence required is based on organizational continuous monitoring
                        strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to the
                        monitoring process. To achieve such impartiality, assessors should not
                        create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the
                        assessments are being conducted; assess their own work; act as management or

        <title>PENETRATION TESTING</title>
        <statement>
            <description>Conduct penetration testing [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] on
                [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on
                systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be
                exploited by adversaries. Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability
                scanning and is most effectively conducted by penetration testing agents and teams
                with demonstrable skills and experience that, depending on the scope of the
                penetration testing, include technical expertise in network, operating system,
                and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to either
                validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of
                systems to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include, for
                example, time, resources, and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the
                actions of adversaries in carrying out attacks against organizations and provides a
                more in-depth analysis of security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies.
                Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration
                testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted on the hardware, software,
                or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical
                controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes, for example, pretest
                analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; pretest identification of
                potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and testing designed to
                determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the
                rules of engagement before commencement of penetration testing scenarios.
                Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the
                tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries
                carrying out attacks. Risk assessments guide the decisions on the level of
                independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by
                        examining the security and privacy posture of organizations and their
                        ability to implement effective cyber defenses. Red team exercises reflect
                        simulated attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational missions and
                        business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the security
                        and privacy state of systems and organizations. Simulated attempts by
                        adversaries to compromise missions and business functions and the systems
                        that support those missions and functions may include technology-based
                        attacks and social engineering-based attacks. Technology-based attacks
                        include interactions with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or
                        mission and business processes. Social engineering-based attacks include
                        interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or personal
                        conversations. Red team exercises are most effectively conducted by
                        penetration testing agents and teams with knowledge of and experience with
                        current adversarial tactics, techniques, procedures, and tools. While
                        penetration testing may be primarily laboratory-based testing, organizations
                        can use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that
                        reflect real-world conditions. Red team exercises can be used to improve
                        security and privacy awareness and training and to assess control
                        effectiveness.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the CM family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>This control establishes baseline configurations for systems and system
                components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of systems.
                Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed and agreed-upon sets of
                specifications for systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline
                configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes to
                systems. Baseline configurations include information about system components,
                network topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system
                architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as
                organizational systems change over time. Baseline configurations of systems reflect
                the current enterprise architecture.</description>

                    <description>Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent

                    <description>Establishing separate baseline configurations for development,
                        testing, and operational environments helps protect systems from
                        unplanned/unexpected events related to development and testing activities.
                        Separate baseline configurations allow organizations to apply the
                        configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of
                        configuration. For example, management of operational configurations
                        typically emphasizes the need for stability, while management of
                        development/test configurations requires greater flexibility. Configurations
                        in the test environment mirror the configurations in the operational
                        environment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are
                        representative of the proposed changes to the operational systems. This
                        control enhancement requires separate configurations but not necessarily
                        separate physical environments.</description>

                    <description>When it is known that systems or system components will be in
                        high-risk areas, additional controls may be implemented to counter the
                        increased threat in such areas. For example, organizations can take specific
                        actions for notebook computers used by individuals departing on and
                        returning from travel. These actions can include, for example, determining
                        which locations are of concern, defining required configurations for the
                        devices, ensuring that the devices are configured as intended before travel
                        is initiated, and applying specific safeguards to the component after travel
                        is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include, for example,
                        computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and more
                        stringent configuration settings. Specified safeguards applied to mobile
                        devices upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device
                        for signs of physical tampering; and purging and reimaging the hard disk
                        drive. Protecting information residing on mobile devices is covered in the
                        media protection family.</description>

            <description>Configuration change controls for organizational systems involve the
                systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition
                of changes to the systems, including system upgrades and modifications.
                Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations for
                components and configuration items of systems; changes to configuration settings for
                component products; unscheduled or unauthorized changes; and changes to remediate
                vulnerabilities. Configuration change control elements can include such entities as
                committees or boards. Typical processes for managing configuration changes to
                systems include, for example, Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards
                that review and approve proposed changes to systems. For new development systems or
                systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives
                from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards or Change
                Advisory Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities before and after changes
                are made to organizational systems and the auditing activities required to implement
                such changes.</description>

            <description>Organizational personnel with security or privacy responsibilities conduct
                impact analyses. Individuals conducting impact analyses possess the necessary skills
                and technical expertise to analyze the changes to systems and the associated
                security or privacy ramifications. Security and privacy impact analyses include, for
                example, reviewing security and privacy plans, policies, and procedures to
                understand security and privacy control requirements; reviewing system design
                documentation to understand control implementation and how specific changes might
                affect the controls; and determining how potential changes to a system create new
                risks to the privacy of individuals and the ability of implemented controls to
                mitigate those risks. Impact analyses may also include assessments of risk to better
                understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional security or
                privacy controls are required.</description>

                    <description>Separate test environment in this context means an environment that
                        is physically or logically isolated and distinct from the operational
                        environment. The separation is sufficient to ensure that activities in the
                        test environment do not impact activities in the operational environment,
                        and information in the operational environment is not inadvertently
                        transmitted to the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved
                        by physical or logical means. If physically separate test environments are
                        not used, organizations determine the strength of mechanism required when
                        implementing logical separation.</description>

            <description>Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of
                systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the
                systems. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals
                to access systems for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and
                modifications. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries.
                Access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls (see
                AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e., changes
                implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change

            <description>Configuration settings are the parameters that can be changed in hardware,
                software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture or
                functionality of the system. Information technology products for which
                security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example,
                mainframe computers, servers, workstations, input/output devices, network devices,
                operating systems, and applications. Security-related parameters are those
                parameters impacting the security state of systems including the parameters required
                to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include,
                for example, registry settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and
                settings for functions, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Organizations
                establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific
                configuration settings for systems. The established settings become part of the
                systems configuration baseline. Common secure configurations (also referred to as
                security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference
                guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized,
                and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific
                information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those
                system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can
                be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information
                technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia,
                industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private
                sectors. Implementation of a specific common secure configuration may be mandated at

            <description>Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the
                functions and services routinely provided by default, may not be necessary to
                support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally,
                it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single system
                component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by that
                single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a
                single function per component. Organizations review functions and services provided
                by systems or components of systems, to determine which functions and services are
                candidates for elimination. Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary
                physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of
                devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network
                scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection
                technologies such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to
                identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and
                services. Related Controls: AC-3, AC-4, CM-2, CM-5, CM-11, RA-5, SA-4, SA-5, SA-9,

                        comprehensive whitelisting and increase the strength of protection for
                        attacks that bypass application level whitelisting, software programs may be
                        decomposed into and monitored at multiple levels of detail. Software program
                        levels of detail include, for example, applications, application programming
                        interfaces, application modules, scripts, system processes, system services,
                        kernel actions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link libraries. The concept

            <description>System components are discrete identifiable information technology assets
                that represent a building block of a system and include hardware, software,
                firmware, and virtual machines. Organizations may choose to implement centralized
                system component inventories that include components from all organizational
                systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the inventories include
                system-specific information required for proper component accountability.
                Information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes,
                for example, hardware inventory specifications; software license information;
                software component owners; version numbers; and for networked components or devices,
                the machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include, for
                example, manufacturer; device type; model; serial number; and physical
                location.</description>

                        the periodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms can
                        be implemented within systems or in other separate devices. Isolation can be
                        achieved, for example, by placing unauthorized system components in separate

            <description>Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration
                management policies while being tailored to individual systems. Such plans define
                processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system
                development life cycle activities. Configuration management plans are typically
                developed during the development and acquisition phase of the system development
                life cycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management
                processes, how to update configuration settings and baselines, how to maintain
                system component inventories, how to control development, test, and operational
                environments, and how to develop, release, and update key documents. Organizations
                can employ templates to help ensure consistent and timely development and
                implementation of configuration management plans. Such templates can represent a
                master configuration management plan for the organization with subsets of the plan
                implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes
                include designation of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and
                approving proposed changes to systems, and personnel that conduct security impact
                analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items
                are the system components (i.e., hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to
                be configuration-managed. As systems continue through the system development life
                cycle, new configuration items may be identified and some existing configuration
                items may no longer need to be under configuration control.</description>

                    <description>In the absence of dedicated configuration management teams assigned
                        within organizations, system developers may be tasked to develop

                        involved in system development or integration. This separation of duties
                        ensures that organizations establish and maintain a sufficient degree of
                        independence between the system development and integration processes and
                        configuration management processes to facilitate quality control and more

                    <description>Open source software refers to software that is available in source
                        code form. Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders
                        are routinely provided under software license agreements that permit
                        individuals to study, change, and improve the software. From a security
                        perspective, the major advantage of open source software is that it provides
                        organizations with the ability to examine the source code. However, there
                        are also various licensing issues associated with open source software
                        including, for example, the constraints on derivative use of such
                        software.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the CP family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall organizational
                program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions.
                Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative
                mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. The
                effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning
                throughout the system development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on
                hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of achieving
                system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for
                organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the
                level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect
                applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and
                guidelines. In addition to availability, contingency plans address other
                security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission or business
                effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or
                integrity of systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example,
                orderly and graceful degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode,
                alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are
                under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling
                activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary planning activities are in
                place and activated in the event of a security incident.</description>

                    <description>Conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for
                        information processing, telecommunications, and environmental support exists
                        during contingency operations.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>Capacity planning is needed because different types of threats can
                        result in a reduction of the available processing, telecommunications, and
                        support services intended to support the organizational missions and
                        business functions. Organizations need to anticipate degraded operations
                        during contingency operations and factor such degradation into capacity
                        planning. With respect to capacity planning, environmental support refers to
                        any environmental support factor for which the organization determines that
                        it needs to provide support in a contingency situation, even if in a
                        degraded state. As always, such determinations are based on an assessment of
                        risk, system categorization (impact level), and organizational risk
                        tolerance.</description>

                        business functions.</description>

                    <description>Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning
                        activities in this control enhancement as part of organizational criticality
                        analysis or business continuity planning including, for example, as part of
                        business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical system assets so
                        additional safeguards and countermeasures can be employed (beyond those
                        safeguards and countermeasures routinely implemented) to help ensure that
                        organizational missions/business functions can continue to be conducted
                        during contingency operations. The identification of critical information
                        assets also facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources.
                        Critical system assets include both technical and operational aspects.
                        Technical aspects include, for example, information technology services,
                        system components, information technology products, and mechanisms.
                        Operational aspects include, for example, procedures (manually executed
                        operations) and personnel (individuals operating technical safeguards and/or
                        executing manual procedures). Organizational program protection plans can
                        aid in identifying critical assets.</description>

            <description>Contingency training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned
                roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the
                appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example,
                regular users may only need to know when and where to report for duty during
                contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; system administrators may
                require additional training on how to set up systems at alternate processing and
                storage sites; and managers/senior leaders may receive more specific training on how
                to conduct mission-essential functions in designated off-site locations and how to
                establish communications with other governmental entities for purposes of
                coordination on contingency-related activities. Training for contingency
                roles/responsibilities reflects the specific continuity requirements in the
                contingency plan.</description>

                walk-through and tabletop exercises, checklists, simulations (parallel, full

            <description>Alternate storage sites are sites that are geographically distinct from
                primary storage sites. An alternate storage site maintains duplicate copies of
                information and data if the primary storage site is not available. Items covered by
                alternate storage site agreements include, for example, environmental conditions at
                alternate sites, access rules, physical and environmental protection requirements,
                and coordination of delivery/retrieval of backup media. Alternate storage sites
                reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that organizations can maintain
                essential missions and business functions despite disruption, compromise, or failure
                in organizational systems.</description>

            <description>Alternate processing sites are sites that are geographically distinct from
                primary processing sites. An alternate processing site provides processing
                capability if the primary processing site is not available. Geographically
                distributed architectures may also be considered as alternate processing sites.
                Safeguards that are covered by alternate processing site agreements include, for
                example, environmental conditions at alternate sites; access rules; physical and
                environmental protection requirements; and the coordination for the transfer and
                assignment of personnel. Requirements are specifically allocated to alternate
                processing sites that reflect the requirements in contingency plans to maintain
                essential missions and business functions despite disruption, compromise, or failure
                in organizational systems.</description>

                        defined in organizational assessments of risk and include, for example,

                        omission/commission. Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient
                        degree of separation between primary and alternate processing sites based on
                        the types of threats that are of concern. For threats such as hostile
                        attacks, the degree of separation between sites is less

            <description>This control applies to telecommunications services (data and voice) for

        <statement>
            <description>Provide for the recovery and reconstitution of the system to a known state
                after a disruption, compromise, or failure within [Assignment: organization-defined

        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Recovery is executing contingency plan activities to restore organizational
                missions and business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and
                includes activities for returning systems to fully operational states. Recovery and
                reconstitution operations reflect mission and business priorities, recovery point,
                time, and reconstitution objectives, and established organizational metrics
                consistent with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes the
                deactivation of any interim system capabilities that may have been needed during
                recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully restored
                system capabilities, reestablishment of continuous monitoring activities, system
                reauthorizations (if required), and activities to prepare the systems against future
                disruptions, compromises, or failures. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities
                employed by organizations can include both automated mechanisms and manual
                procedures.</description>

            <description>For systems supporting critical missions and business functions including,
                for example, military operations and weapons systems, civilian space operations,
                nuclear power plant operations, and air traffic control operations (especially

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>This control supports system resiliency, contingency planning, and
                continuity of operations. To ensure mission and business continuity, organizations
                can implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. These mechanisms may
                be less effective than the primary mechanisms. However, having the capability to
                readily employ these alternative or supplemental mechanisms, enhances mission and
                business continuity that might otherwise be adversely impacted if operations had to
                be curtailed until the primary means of implementing the functions was restored.
                Given the cost and level of effort required to provide such alternative
                capabilities, this control is typically applied only to critical security
                capabilities provided by systems, system components, or system services. For
                example, an organization may issue to senior executives and system administrators
                one-time pads if multifactor tokens, the standard means for secure remote
                authentication, is compromised.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the IA family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

        <title>IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)</title>
        <statement>
            <description>Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users or processes acting
                on behalf of organizational users.</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication
                requirements in this control by complying with the requirements in Homeland Security
                Presidential Directive 12. Organizational users include employees or individuals
                that organizations consider having the equivalent status of employees including, for
                example, contractors and guest researchers. This control applies to all accesses
                other than accesses that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through
                the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication.
                Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or
                for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords,
                physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the
                case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to
                organizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local
                access is any access to organizational systems by users or processes acting on
                behalf of users, where such access is obtained through direct connections without
                the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational systems by users (or
                processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network
                connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access
                that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include
                local area networks and wide area networks. The use of encrypted virtual private
                networks for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and
                non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with
                respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing
                the network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational
                users are described in IA-8.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more
                        different factors to achieve authentication. Factors are defined as follows:
                        something you know, for example, a password or personal identification
                        number (PIN); something you have, for example, a physical authenticator or
                        cryptographic identification device; or something you are, for example, a
                        biometric. Multifactor solutions that feature physical authenticators
                        include, for example, hardware authenticators providing time-based or
                        challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S.
                        Government Personal Identity Verification card or the DoD common access
                        card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level (i.e., at
                        logon), organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the
                        application level, at their discretion, to provide increased information
                        security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e., local, network, or remote)
                        privileged accounts are always authenticated using multifactor options
                        appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security
                        measures, such as additional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for
                        specific types of access.</description>

                        something you know, for example, a personal identification number (PIN);
                        something you have, for example, a physical authenticator or cryptographic
                        private key stored in hardware or software; or something you are, for
                        example, a biometric. Multifactor solutions that feature physical
                        authenticators include, for example, hardware authenticators providing
                        time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the
                        U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card or the DoD common access
                        card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level, organizations
                        may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their
                        discretion, to provide increased information security. Organizations can
                        also provide additional security measures, such as additional or more
                        rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of
                        access.</description>

            <description>Devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and authentication
                are defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type and device.
                Organization-defined device types may include devices that are not owned by the
                organization. Systems use shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC]
                or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device
                identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and
                Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer
                Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate devices on
                local and wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of
                authentication mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and
                mission/business requirements. Because of the challenges of implementing this
                control on large scale, organizations can restrict the application of the control to
                a limited number (and type) of devices based on organizational need.</description>

                        important that patches and updates to the device are handled via a
                        configuration management process such that the patches and updates are done
                        securely and at the same time do not disrupt the identification and
                        authentication to other devices.</description>

            <description>Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control (MAC),
                Internet Protocol addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of
                individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically,
                individual identifiers are the user names of the system accounts assigned to those
                individuals. In such instances, the account management activities of AC-2 use
                account names provided by IA-4. This control also addresses individual identifiers
                not necessarily associated with system accounts. Preventing the reuse of identifiers
                implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, or
                device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or
                devices.</description>

            <description>Examples of individual authenticators include passwords, cryptographic
                devices, one-time password devices, and key cards. The initial authenticator content
                is the actual content of the authenticator, for example, the initial password. In
                contrast, the requirements about authenticator content include, for example, the
                minimum password length. Developers may ship system components with factory default
                authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration.
                Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and
                present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual
                authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the
                possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators
                stored in organizational systems including, for example, passwords stored in hashed
                or encrypted formats or files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible
                with administrator privileges. Systems support authenticator management by
                organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator
                characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, validation time
                window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during
                the verification stage of biometric authentication. Actions that can be taken to
                safeguard individual authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of
                authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with others, and reporting
                lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management
                includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary
                access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include,
                for example, certificates and passwords.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity
                        and the authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional
                        approaches, this binding is established by pre-provisioning both the
                        identity and the authenticator to the system. For example, the binding
                        between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., authenticator) is
                        accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the
                        system. New authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity
                        and the authenticator to be implemented outside a system. For example, with
                        smartcard credentials, the identity and the authenticator are bound together
                        on the smartcard. Using these credentials, systems can authenticate
                        identities that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically provisioning the
                        identity after authentication. In these situations, organizations can
                        anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities. Pre-established trust
                        relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate
                        identities and related credentials are essential.</description>

                        presented biometric and stored biometric which serves as the basis of
                        comparison. The matching performance is the rate at which a biometric
                        algorithm correctly results in a match for a genuine user and rejects other
                        users. Biometric performance requirements include, for example, the match
                        rate as this reflects the accuracy of the biometric matching algorithm being
                        used by a system.</description>

                    <description>Biometric characteristics do not constitute secrets. Such
                        characteristics can be obtained by online web accesses; taking a picture of
                        someone with a camera phone to obtain facial images with or without their
                        knowledge; lifting from objects that someone has touched, for example, a
                        latent fingerprint; or capturing a high-resolution image, for example, an
                        iris pattern. Presentation attack detection technologies including, for
                        example, liveness detection, can mitigate the risk of these types of attacks
                        by making it more difficult to produce artifacts intended to defeat the

        <statement>
            <description>Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication
                process to protect the information from possible exploitation and use by
                unauthorized individuals.</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>The feedback from systems does not provide information that would allow
                unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of
                systems or system components, for example, desktops/notebooks with relatively large
                monitors, the threat (referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other
                types of systems or components, for example, mobile devices with small displays,
                this threat may be less significant, and is balanced against the increased
                likelihood of typographic input errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore, the
                means for obscuring authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring
                authenticator feedback includes, for example, displaying asterisks when users type
                passwords into input devices, or displaying feedback for a very limited time before
                fully obscuring it.</description>

        <statement>
            <description>Require individuals accessing the system to employ [Assignment:
                organization-defined supplemental authentication techniques or mechanisms] under
                specific [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances or

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms and
                subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. This situation can potentially
                occur with any authentication mechanisms employed by organizations. To address this
                threat, organizations may employ specific techniques or mechanisms and establish
                protocols to assess suspicious behavior. Such behavior may include, for example,
                accessing information that individuals do not typically access as part of their
                duties, roles, or responsibilities; accessing greater quantities of information than
                the individuals would routinely access; or attempting to access information from
                suspicious network addresses. In situations when pre-established conditions or
                triggers occur, organizations can require individuals to provide additional
                authentication information. Another potential use for adaptive authentication is to
                increase the strength of mechanism based on the number and/or types of records being
                accessed. Adaptive authentication does not replace and is not used to avoid
                multifactor mechanisms, but can augment implementations of these
                controls.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the IP family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>This control transfers risk that arises from the processing of personally
                identifiable information from the organization to an individual. It is only selected
                as required by law or regulation or when individuals can be reasonably expected to
                understand and accept any privacy risks arising from their authorization.
                Organizations consider whether other controls may more effectively mitigate privacy
                risk either alone or in conjunction with consent. To help users understand the risks
                being accepted when providing consent, organizations write materials in plain
                language and avoid technical jargon. The examples required in IP-2 a. focus on key
                points necessary for user decision-making. When developing or purchasing consent
                tools, organizations consider the application of good information design procedures
                in all user-facing consent materials; use of active voice and conversational style;
                logical sequencing of main points; consistent use of the same word (rather than
                synonyms) to avoid confusion; the use of bullets, numbers, and formatting where
                appropriate to aid readability; and legibility of text, such as font style, size,

            <description>Redress supports the ability of individuals to ensure the accuracy of their
                personally identifiable information held by organizations. Effective redress
                processes demonstrate organizational commitment to data quality especially in those
                business functions where inaccurate data may result in inappropriate decisions or
                the denial of benefits and services to individuals. Organizations use discretion in
                determining if records are to be corrected or amended, based on the scope of redress
                requests, the changes sought, and the impact of the changes. Other authorized users
                of personally identifiable information include, for example, external
                information-sharing partners. An effective redress process includes: providing
                effective notice of the existence of a personally identifiable information
                collection; providing plain language explanations of the processes and mechanisms
                for requesting access to records; establishing the criteria for submitting requests
                for correction or amendment of records; implementing resources to analyze and
                adjudicate requests; implementing means of correcting or amending data collections;

            <description>Access affords individuals the ability to review personally identifiable

                includes timely, simplified, and inexpensive access to data. Organizational
                processes for allowing access to records may differ based on resources, legal
                requirements, or other factors. The Senior Agency Official for Privacy is
                responsible for the content of Privacy Act regulations and record request
                processing, in consultation with legal counsel. Access to certain types of records
                may not be appropriate, and heads of agencies may promulgate rules exempting
                specific systems from the access provision of the Privacy Act. When feasible, those
                rules will be publicly available. In addition, individuals are not entitled to

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the IR family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

                of organizational personnel to ensure the appropriate content and level of detail is
                included in such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or
                how to recognize an incident; system administrators may require additional training
                on how to handle and remediate incidents; and finally, incident responders may
                receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery, and
                restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification
                and reporting of suspicious activities, both from external and internal
                sources.</description>

            <description>It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated
                approach to incident response. Organizational missions, business functions,
                strategies, goals, and objectives for incident response help to determine the
                structure of incident response capabilities. As part of a comprehensive incident
                response capability, organizations consider the coordination and sharing of
                information with external organizations, including, for example, external service
                providers and organizations involved in the supply chain for organizational systems.
                For incidents involving personally identifiable information, include a process to
                determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is
                appropriate and provide that notice accordingly.</description>

                corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational response is
                generally based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information, the
                security capabilities of the system, the specific nature of contaminated storage
                media, and the access authorizations of individuals with authorized access to the
                contaminated system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill
                after the fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to
                minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such contamination
                is isolated and eradicated.</description>

        <statement>
            <description>Establish an integrated team of forensic and malicious code analysts, tool

        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information
                sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers,
                implementers, and operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat to
                implement defensive measures that will enable organizations to deter intrusions more
                effectively. Moreover, integrated teams promote the rapid detection of intrusions,
                development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive
                measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated analysis team
                can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate
                the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing
                intelligence development. This enables the team to identify adversary tactics,
                techniques, and procedures that are linked to the operations tempo or to specific
                missions and business functions, and to define responsive actions in a way that does
                not disrupt those missions and business functions. Information security analysis
                teams are distributed within organizations to make the capability more
                resilient.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the MA family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>This control addresses security-related issues associated with maintenance
                tools that are not within organizational system boundaries but are used specifically
                for diagnostic and repair actions on organizational systems. Organizations have
                flexibility in determining roles for approval of maintenance tools and how that
                approval is documented. Periodic review of system maintenance tools facilitates
                withdrawal of the approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-used
                tools. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items.
                Maintenance tools are potential vehicles for transporting malicious code,
                intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into systems.
                Maintenance tools can include, for example, hardware/software diagnostic test
                equipment and hardware and software packet sniffers. This control does not cover
                hardware or software components that support system maintenance and are a part of
                the system, for example, the software implementing ping, ls, ipconfig, or the
                hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet
                switch.</description>

            <description>Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities
                conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network
                or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those
                activities carried out by individuals physically present at the system or system
                component and not communicating across a network connection. Authentication
                techniques used in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions
                reflect the network access requirements in IA-2. Strong authentication requires
                authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor
                authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates
                are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing
                requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by other controls.</description>

                    <description>Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and servicing of
                        system components to maintain equipment and facilities in satisfactory
                        operating condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic
                        inspection, tests, measurements, adjustments, parts replacement, detection,
                        and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they
                        develop into major defects. The primary goal of preventive maintenance is to
                        avoid/mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive
                        maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by
                        replacing worn components before they fail. Methods of determining what
                        preventive (or other) failure management policies to apply include, for
                        example, original equipment manufacturer recommendations, statistical

                    <description>Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to
                        evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous
                        (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance
                        is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance
                        activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance
                        within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive maintenance stems
                        from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition.
                        This approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at
                        what point in the future maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most
                        predictive maintenance inspections are performed while equipment is in
                        service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system operations.
                        Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher
                        system reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of
                        the item. To evaluate equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes
                        nondestructive testing technologies such as infrared, acoustic (partial
                        discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration analysis,
                        sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online
                        tests.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the MP family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>System media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media
                includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk
                drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media
                includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Restricting non-digital media access
                includes, for example, denying access to patient medical records in a community
                hospital unless the individuals seeking access to such records are authorized
                healthcare providers. Restricting access to digital media includes, for example,
                limiting access to design specifications stored on compact disks in the media
                library to the project leader and the individuals on the development
                team.</description>

            <description>Security marking refers to the application or use of human-readable
                security attributes. Security labeling refers to the application or use of security
                attributes regarding internal data structures within systems. System media includes
                both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes,
                magnetic tapes, external or removable disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and
                digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm.
                Security marking is generally not required for media containing information
                determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable.
                However, some organizations may require markings for public information indicating
                that the information is publicly releasable. Marking of system media reflects
                applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
                guidelines.</description>

            <description>System media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media
                includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk
                drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media
                includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Physically controlling system media
                includes, for example, conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to
                allow individuals to check out and return media to the media library, and
                maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes, for example, a
                locked drawer, desk, or cabinet; or a controlled media library. The type of media
                storage employed by organizations is commensurate with the security category or
                classification of the information residing on the media. Controlled areas are areas
                that provide sufficient physical and procedural safeguards to meet the requirements
                established for protecting information and systems. For media containing information
                determined to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited
                or no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if accessed by other than
                authorized personnel, fewer safeguards may be needed. In these situations, physical
                access controls provide adequate protection.</description>

            <description>System media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media
                includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk
                drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media
                includes, for example, microfilm and paper. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for
                which organizations provide sufficient physical or procedural safeguards to meet
                requirements established for protecting information and systems. Physical and
                technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category or
                classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect media
                during transport include, for example, locked containers and cryptography.
                Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections
                depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the
                actual transport as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport
                and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual
                transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from
                outside the organization. Maintaining accountability of media during transport
                includes, for example, restricting transport activities to authorized personnel, and
                tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of transport activities as the media
                moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or
                tampering. Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities
                associated with the transport of system media in accordance with organizational
                assessments of risk to include the flexibility to define different record-keeping
                methods for the different types of media transport as part of an overall system of
                transport-related records.</description>

            </statement>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>This control applies to all system media, both digital and non-digital,
                subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable.
                Examples include: digital media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook
                computers, workstations, network components, mobile devices; and non-digital media
                such as paper and microfilm. The sanitization process removes information from the
                media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization
                techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction,
                prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is
                reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate
                sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other
                methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use
                discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for
                media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly
                releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if
                released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for
                example, destruction, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified
                document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the
                redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them
                from the document. NARA policy and guidance control the sanitization process for
                controlled unclassified information. NSA standards and policies control the
                sanitization process for media containing classified information.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>Portable storage devices can be the source of malicious code
                        insertions into organizational systems. Many of these devices are obtained
                        from untrustworthy sources and may contain malicious code that can be
                        readily transferred to systems through USB ports or other entry portals.
                        While scanning storage devices is recommended, sanitization provides
                        additional assurance that such devices are free of malicious code.
                        Organizations consider nondestructive sanitization of portable storage
                        devices when these devices are purchased from manufacturers or vendors prior

                    <description>Organizations employ dual authorization to ensure that system media
                        sanitization cannot occur unless two technically qualified individuals
                        conduct the designated task. Individuals sanitizing system media possess
                        sufficient skills and expertise to determine if the proposed sanitization
                        reflects applicable federal and organizational standards, policies, and
                        procedures. Dual authorization also helps to ensure that sanitization occurs
                        as intended, both protecting against errors and false claims of having
                        performed the sanitization actions. Dual authorization may also be known as

                        organizational systems and system components if such systems or components
                        are obtained by unauthorized individuals. Remote purge/wipe commands require
                        strong authentication to mitigate the risk of unauthorized individuals
                        purging/wiping the system/component/device. The purge or wipe function can
                        be implemented in a variety of ways including, for example, by overwriting
                        data/information multiple times or by destroying the key necessary to
                        decrypt encrypted data.</description>

            </statement>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media
                includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk
                drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media
                includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile
                devices with information storage capability. In contrast to MP-2, which restricts
                user access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of media on
                systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash drives or external
                hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical safeguards to
                restrict the use of system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable
                storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit
                access to certain external ports, or disabling or removing the ability to insert,
                read or write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable
                storage devices to only approved devices including, for example, devices provided by
                the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that
                are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable
                storage devices based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of
                writeable, portable storage devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling
                or removing the capability to write to such devices. Requiring identifiable owners
                for portable storage devices reduces the risk of using such devices by allowing
                organizations to assign responsibility for addressing known vulnerabilities in the
                devices.</description>

                        Certain types of media do not support sanitize commands, or if supported,
                        the interfaces are not supported in a standardized way across these devices.
                        Sanitization-resistant media include, for example, compact flash, embedded
                        flash on boards and devices, solid state drives, and USB removable
                        media.</description>

            <description>This control applies to all system media, digital and non-digital, subject
                to release outside of the organization, whether the media is considered removable or
                not removeable. The downgrading process, when applied to system media, removes
                information from the media, typically by security category or classification level,
                such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Downgrading of media
                includes redacting information to enable wider release and distribution. It also
                ensures that empty space on the media is devoid of information.</description>

                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and

                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate

                Organizational officials consult with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy and
                legal counsel regarding the authority of any program or activity to collect
                personally identifiable information. The authority to collect personally
                identifiable information is documented in the System of Records Notice and/or
                Privacy Impact Assessment or other applicable documentation such as Privacy Act

        <statement>
            <description>Identify and document the purpose(s) for which personally identifiable
                information is collected, used, maintained, and shared in its privacy

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Statutory language often expressly authorizes specific collections and uses
                of personally identifiable information. When statutory language is written broadly
                and thus subject to interpretation, organizations consult with the Senior Agency
                Official for Privacy and legal counsel to verify that there is a close nexus between
                the general authorization and any specific collection of personally identifiable
                information. Once the specific purpose has been identified, the purpose is clearly
                described in the related privacy compliance documentation, including, for example,
                Privacy Impact Assessments, System of Records Notices, and Privacy Act Statements
                provided at the time of collection including, for example, on forms organizations
                use to collect personally identifiable information. Further, in order to avoid
                unauthorized collections or uses of personally identifiable information, personnel
                who manage such information receive role-based training as specified in
                AT-3.</description>

                        identifiable information is used only for legally authorized purposes and in

                        public notices. These steps include, for example, monitoring and auditing
                        organizational use of personally identifiable information and training
                        organizational personnel on the authorized uses of such information. With
                        guidance from the Senior Agency Official for Privacy and where appropriate,
                        legal counsel, organizations document the processes and procedures for
                        evaluating the proposed new uses of personally identifiable information to
                        assess whether such uses fall within the scope of the organizational

            <description>Security safeguards applied to system distribution and transmission lines
                prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such safeguards may
                also be necessary to help prevent eavesdropping or modification of unencrypted
                transmissions. Safeguards used to control physical access to system distribution and
                transmission lines include, for example, locked wiring closets; disconnected or
                locked spare jacks; protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays; and wiretapping

            <description>Monitoring of physical access includes publicly accessible areas within
                organizational facilities. This can be accomplished for example, by the employment
                of guards; the use of video surveillance equipment such as cameras; or the use of
                sensor devices. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations
                of and responses to detected physical security incidents. Security incidents
                include, for example, security violations or suspicious physical access activities.
                Suspicious physical access activities include, for example, accesses outside of
                normal work hours; repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed; accesses for
                unusual lengths of time; and out-of-sequence accesses.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the PL family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policies or can
                be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations.
                The procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems,
                if needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to a
                set of security and privacy controls and control enhancements. The plans describe
                how the security and privacy controls and control enhancements meet those security
                and privacy requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the
                specific design or implementation of the controls and control enhancements. Security
                and privacy plans contain sufficient information (including the specification of
                parameter values for assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by
                reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant
                with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational
                operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan
                is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the
                control baselines in Appendix D to develop overlays for community-wide use or to
                address specialized requirements, technologies, missions, business applications, or
                environments of operation. Security and privacy plans need not be single documents.
                The plans can be a collection of various documents including documents that already
                exist. Effective security and privacy plans make extensive use of references to
                policies, procedures, and additional documents including, for example, design and
                implementation specifications where more detailed information can be obtained. This
                reduces the documentation associated with security and privacy programs and
                maintains the security- and privacy-related information in other established
                management and operational areas including, for example, enterprise architecture,
                system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. Thus, security
                and privacy plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan
                information but instead provide explicitly or by reference, sufficient information
                to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.</description>

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>This control enhancement applies to organizational users. Organizations
                consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and responsibilities,
                differentiating, for example, between rules that apply to privileged users and rules
                that apply to the general user population. Establishing rules of behavior for some
                types of non-organizational users including, for example, individuals who simply
                receive data or information from federal systems, is often not feasible given the
                large number of such users and the limited nature of their interactions with the
                systems. Rules of behavior for organizational and non-organizational users can also
                be established in AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4b, the documented
                acknowledgment portion of the control, may be satisfied by the security and privacy
                awareness training and the role-based security and privacy training programs
                conducted by organizations if such training includes rules of behavior. Documented
                acknowledgements for rules of behavior may include, for example, electronic or
                physical signatures; and electronic agreement check boxes/radio
                buttons.</description>

            <description>This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and
                development of systems. The security and privacy architectures at the system level
                are consistent with and complement the organization-wide security and privacy
                architectures described in PM-7 that are integral to and developed as part of the
                enterprise architecture. The security and privacy architectures include an
                architectural description, the placement and allocation of security and privacy
                functionality (including security and privacy controls), security- and
                privacy-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged
                across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface.
                In addition, the security and privacy architectures can include other information,
                for example, user roles and the access privileges assigned to each role, unique
                security and privacy requirements, types of information processed, stored, and
                transmitted by the system, restoration priorities of information and system
                services, and any other specific protection needs. In todays modern computing
                architectures, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all
                information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information
                services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and
                privacy architectures is important to developing a comprehensive mission and
                business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining
                under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational systems is
                critical to implementing and maintaining effective security and privacy
                architectures. The development of the security and privacy architectures is
                coordinated with the Senior Agency Information Security Officer and the Senior
                Agency Official for Privacy to ensure that security and privacy controls needed to
                support security and privacy requirements are identified and effectively
                implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations to ensure that they develop
                security and privacy architectures for the system, and that the architectures are
                integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the
                organization-wide security and privacy architectures. In contrast, SA-17 is
                primarily directed at external information technology product and system developers
                and integrators. SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when
                organizations outsource the development of systems or system components to external
                entities, and there is a need to demonstrate consistency with the organizations
                enterprise architecture and security and privacy architectures.</description>

                    <description>Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards
                        (procedural, technical, or both) in the security architecture so that
                        adversaries must overcome multiple safeguards to achieve their objective.
                        Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple mechanisms makes it more difficult
                        to successfully attack critical information resources by increasing the work
                        factor of the adversary. It also increases the likelihood of detection. The
                        coordination of allocated safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack
                        that involves one safeguard does not create adverse unintended consequences
                        by interfering with other safeguards. Examples of such unintended
                        consequences include system lockout and cascading alarms. Placement of
                        security safeguards is an important activity requiring thoughtful analysis.
                        The criticality or value of the organizational asset is a key consideration
                        in providing additional layering.</description>

                    <description>Different information technology products have different strengths
                        and weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the
                        individual offerings. For example, vendors offering malicious code
                        protection typically update their products at different times, often
                        developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms based on their
                        priorities and development schedules. By having different products at
                        different locations there is an increased likelihood that at least one will
                        detect the malicious code.</description>

                controls and related processes].</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Central management refers to the organization-wide management and
                implementation of selected security and privacy controls and related processes. This
                includes planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the
                organization-defined, centrally managed controls and processes. As the central
                management of security and privacy controls is generally associated with the concept
                of common controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of
                control implementations and management and judicious use of organizational
                resources. Centrally-managed controls and processes may also meet independence
                requirements for assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to
                operate and as part of organizational continuous monitoring. As part of the security
                and privacy control selection processes, organizations determine which controls may
                be suitable for central management based on organizational resources and
                capabilities. It is not always possible to centrally manage every aspect of a
                security or privacy control. In such cases, the control can be treated as a hybrid
                control with the control managed and implemented centrally or at the system level.
                Those controls and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial
                central management include, but are not limited to: AC-2 (1) (2) (3) (4); AC-17 (1)

            <description>Select a control baseline for the system.</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>The selection of an appropriate control baseline is determined by the needs
                of organizational stakeholders. Stakeholder needs and concerns consider mission and
                business requirements and mandates imposed by applicable laws, Executive Orders,
                directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the three
                control baselines in Appendix D are based on the requirements from the Federal
                Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and the Privacy Act. These
                requirements, along with the NIST standards and guidelines implementing the
                legislation, require organizations to select one of the control baselines after the
                reviewing the information types and the information that is processed, stored, and
                transmitted on organizational systems; analyzing the potential adverse impact or
                consequences of the loss or compromise of the system or information on the
                organizations operations and assets, individuals, other organizations or the
                Nation; and considering the results from organizational and system assessments of
                risk. Nonfederal organizations that are part of other communities of interest
                including the U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, can develop similar control
                baselines (using the controls in Chapter Three) that represent the needs and
                concerns of those entities.</description>

        <title>BASELINE TAILORING</title>
        <statement>
            <description>Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring
                actions.</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize a
                set of baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. These
                actions facilitate such specialization and customization by allowing organizations
                to develop security and privacy plans that reflect their specific missions and
                business functions, the environments where their systems operate, the threats and
                vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other conditions or
                situations that can impact their mission or business success. The tailoring actions
                are described in Appendix G. Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by
                identifying and designating common controls; applying scoping considerations;
                selecting compensating controls; assigning values to control parameters;
                supplementing the control baseline with additional controls, as needed; and
                providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in
                Appendix G can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of
                organizations. Tailoring actions can be applied to the baselines in Appendix D in
                accordance with the security requirements from the Federal Information Security
                Modernization Act (FISMA) and the privacy requirements from the Privacy Act.
                Alternatively, other communities of interest adopting different control baselines
                can apply the tailoring actions in Appendix G to specialize or customize the
                controls that represent the specific needs and concerns of those
                entities.</description>

            <description>Information security program plans can be represented in single documents
                or compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document
                the program management controls and organization-defined common controls.
                Information security program plans provide sufficient information about the program
                management controls/common controls (including specification of parameters for any
                assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable
                implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a
                determination of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.
                Security plans for individual systems and the organization-wide information security
                program plan, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within
                the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the
                organizations information security program plan unless the controls are included in
                a separate security plan for a system. The organization-wide information security
                program plan will indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of
                common controls. Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a
                single document or in multiple documents. For multiple documents, the documents
                describing common controls are included as attachments to the information security
                program plan. If the information security program plan contains multiple documents,
                the organization specifies in each document the organizational official or officials
                responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and
                monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the Facilities Management
                Office may develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common
                physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls
                are not associated with a particular system but instead, support multiple
                systems.</description>

            <description>The integration of security and privacy requirements and controls into the
                enterprise architecture ensures that security and privacy considerations are
                addressed early in the system development life cycle and are directly and explicitly
                related to the organizations mission and business processes. The process of
                security and privacy requirements integration also embeds into the enterprise
                architecture, the organizations security and privacy architectures consistent with
                the organizational risk management and information security and privacy strategies.
                For PM-7, the security and privacy architectures are developed at a
                system-of-systems level, representing all organizational systems. For PL-8, the
                security and privacy architectures are developed at a level representing an
                individual system. The system-level architectures are consistent with the security
                and privacy architectures defined for the organization. Security and privacy
                requirements and control integration are most effectively accomplished through the
                rigorous application of the Risk Management Framework and supporting security
                standards and guidelines.</description>

            <description>An organization-wide risk management strategy includes, for example, an
                expression of the security, privacy, and supply chain risk tolerance for the
                organization; acceptable risk assessment methodologies; security, privacy, and
                supply chain risk mitigation strategies; a process for consistently evaluating
                security, privacy, and supply chain risk across the organization with respect to the
                organizations risk tolerance; and approaches for monitoring risk over time. The
                senior accountable official for risk management (agency head or designated official)
                aligns information security management proceeses with strategic, operational, and
                budgetary planning procceses. The use of a risk executive function, led by the
                senior accountable official for risk management, can facilitate consistent
                application of the risk management strategy organization-wide. The organization-wide
                risk management strategy can be informed by security, privacy, and supply chain
                risk-related inputs from other sources, internal and external to the organization,
                to ensure the strategy is both broad-based and comprehensive.</description>

                system and common control provider. The organizational authorization processes are
                integrated with continuous monitoring processes to facilitate ongoing understanding
                and acceptance of security and privacy risks to organizational operations and
                assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.</description>

            <description>Protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities to
                counter threats to organizations, individuals, systems, and the Nation through the
                compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability,
                or privacy). Information protection and personally identifiable information
                processing needs are derived from mission and business needs defined by the
                stakeholders in organizations, the mission and business processes defined to meet
                those needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information protection
                and personally identifiable information processing needs determine the required
                security and privacy controls for the organization and the systems supporting the
                mission and business processes. Inherent in defining the protection and personally
                identifiable information processing needs, is an understanding of adverse impact or
                consequences that could result if a compromise of information occurs. The
                categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations. Privacy
                risks to individuals can arise from the compromise of personally identifiable
                information, but they can also arise as unintended consequences or a byproduct of
                authorized processing of information at any stage of the data life cycle. Privacy
                risk assessments are used to prioritize the risks that are created for individuals
                from system processing of personally identifiable information. These risk
                assessments enable the selection of the required privacy controls for the
                organization and systems supporting the mission and business processes. Mission and
                business process definitions and the associated protection requirements are
                documented in accordance with organizational policy and procedures.</description>

        <title>INSIDER THREAT PROGRAM</title>
        <statement>
            <description>Implement an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline
                insider threat incident handling team.</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Organizations handling classified information are required, under Executive
                Order 13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider threat
                programs. The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in
                classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of
                Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat
                programs include controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through
                the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and non-technical
                information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior official is
                designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to
                implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized
                integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare
                department or agency insider threat policies and implementation plans; conduct
                host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned
                classified computers; provide insider threat awareness training to employees;
                receive access to information from all offices within the department or agency for
                insider threat analysis; and conduct self-assessments of department or agency
                insider threat posture. Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of
                incident handling teams that organizations may already have in place, such as
                computer security incident response teams. Human resources records are especially
                important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of
                insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace
                including, for example, ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with
                coworkers and other colleagues. These precursors can better inform and guide
                organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. However, the
                use of human resource records could raise significant concerns for privacy. The
                participation of a comprehensive legal team, including consultation with the senior
                agency officer for privacy (SAOP), ensures that all monitoring activities are
                performed in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
                regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.</description>

            <description>Security and privacy workforce development and improvement programs
                include, for example, defining the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to

                programs for individuals assigned security and privacy roles and responsibilities;
                and providing standards and guidelines for measuring and building individual
                qualifications for incumbents and applicants for security- and privacy-related
                positions. Such workforce development and improvement programs can also include
                security and privacy career paths to encourage security and privacy professionals to
                advance in the field and fill positions with greater responsibility. The programs
                encourage organizations to fill security- and privacy-related positions with
                qualified personnel. Security and privacy workforce development and improvement
                programs are complementary to organizational security awareness and training
                programs and focus on developing and institutionalizing the core security and

            <description>This control ensures that organizations provide oversight for the security
                and privacy testing, training, and monitoring activities conducted organization-wide
                and that those activities are coordinated. With the growing importance of continuous
                monitoring programs, the implementation of information security and privacy across
                the three tiers of the risk management hierarchy and the widespread use of common
                controls, organizations coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring
                activities that are routinely conducted as part of ongoing organizational
                assessments supporting a variety of security and privacy controls. Security and
                privacy training activities, while focused on individual systems and specific roles,
                also necessitate coordination across all organizational elements. Testing, training,
                and monitoring plans and activities are informed by current threat and vulnerability
                assessments.</description>

                and privacy professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select groups and

        <statement>
            <description>Implement a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization
                information-sharing capability.</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of
                adversaries, especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it may be more likely
                that adversaries can successfully breach or compromise organizational systems. One
                of the best techniques to address this concern is for organizations to share threat
                information. This can include sharing threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and
                procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that organizations have
                found are effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence (i.e.,
                indications and warnings about threats that can occur). Threat information sharing
                may be bilateral or multilateral. Examples of bilateral threat sharing include
                government-commercial cooperatives and government-government cooperatives. An
                example of multilateral sharing includes organizations taking part in threat-sharing
                consortia. Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring special agreements
                and protection, or less sensitive and freely shared.</description>

            <description>A Privacy program plan is a formal document that provides an overview of an
                organizations privacy program, including a description of the structure of the
                privacy program, the resources dedicated to the privacy program, the role of the
                Senior Agency Official for Privacy and other privacy officials and staff, the
                strategic goals and objectives of the privacy program, and the program management
                and common controls in place or planned for meeting applicable privacy requirements
                and managing privacy risks. Privacy program plans can be integrated with information
                security plans or can be represented independently, either in a single document or
                in compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document
                the program management controls and organization-defined common controls. Privacy
                program plans provide sufficient information about the program management and common
                controls (including specification of parameters and assignment and selection
                statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable control implementations that
                are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the
                risk incurred if the plans are implemented as intended. The privacy plans for
                individual systems and the organization-wide privacy program plan together provide
                complete coverage for all privacy controls employed within the organization. Common
                controls are documented in an appendix to the organizations privacy program plan
                unless the controls are included in a separate privacy plan for a system. The
                organization-wide privacy program plan indicates which separate privacy plans
                contain descriptions of privacy controls. Organizations have the flexibility to
                describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents. In the case
                of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are included as
                attachments to the privacy program plan. If the privacy program plan contains
                multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document, the organizational
                official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment,
                authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls.</description>

            <description>This control addresses disclosure accounting requirements in the Privacy
                Act. The purpose of disclosure accounting requirements is to allow individuals to
                learn to whom records about them have been disclosed; to provide a basis for
                subsequently advising recipients of records of any corrected or disputed records;
                and to provide an audit trail for subsequent reviews of organizational compliance
                with conditions for disclosures. Organizations can use any system for keeping
                notations of disclosures, if it can construct from such a system, a document listing
                of all disclosures. Automated mechanisms can be used by organizations to determine
                when such information is disclosed, including, for example, commercial services
                providing notifications and alerts. Accounting of disclosures may also be used to
                help organizations verify compliance with applicable privacy statutes and policies
                governing disclosure or dissemination of information and dissemination
                restrictions.</description>

        <statement>
            <description>Issue guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, utility, objectivity,
                integrity, impact determination, and de-identification of personally identifiable
                information across the information life cycle.</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Data quality management guidelines include the reasonable steps that
                organizations take to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally identifiable
                information throughout the information life cycle. The information life cycle
                includes the creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance,
                dissemination, disclosure, and disposition of personally identifiable information.
                Such steps may include, for example, editing and validating addresses as they are
                collected or entered into systems using automated address verification look-up
                application programming interfaces. The measures taken to protect data quality are
                based on the nature and context of the personally identifiable information, how it
                is to be used, how it was obtained, the impact level of the personally identifiable
                information obtained, and potential de-identification methods employed. Measures
                taken to validate the accuracy of personally identifiable information that is used
                to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals
                under federal programs may be more comprehensive than those used to validate less
                sensitive personally identifiable information. Additional steps may be necessary to
                validate personally identifiable information that is obtained from sources other
                than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals.</description>

                    <description>As data is obtained and used across the information life cycle, it
                        is important to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally
                        identifiable information. Automated tools and techniques can augment
                        existing process and procedures and enable an organization to better
                        identify and manage personally identifiable information in large-scale
                        systems. For example, automated tools can greatly improve efforts to
                        consistently normalize data or identify malformed data. Automated tools can
                        also be used to improve auditing of data, to track how data is used across
                        the information life cycle, and to detect errors that may incorrectly alter
                        personally identifiable information or incorrectly associate such
                        information with the wrong individual. These automated capabilities backstop
                        processes and procedures at-scale. They also enable more fine-grained
                        detection and correction of data quality errors.</description>

            <description>Access affords individuals the ability to review personally identifiable
                information about them held within organizational systems of records. Access
                includes timely, simplified, and inexpensive access to data. Organizational
                processes for allowing access to records may differ based on resources, legal
                requirements, or other factors. The Senior Agency Official for Privacy is
                responsible for the content of Privacy Act regulations and record request
                processing, in consultation with the organizations legal counsel. Access to certain
                types of records may not be appropriate, however, and heads of agencies may
                promulgate rules exempting particular systems from the access provision of the

            <description>Through internal and external privacy reporting, organizations promote
                accountability and transparency in organizational privacy operations. Reporting can
                also help organizations to determine progress in meeting privacy compliance
                requirements and privacy controls, compare performance across the federal
                government, identify vulnerabilities and gaps in policy and implementation, and
                identify success models. Privacy reports include, for example, annual Senior Agency
                Official for Privacy reports to OMB; reports to Congress required by the
                Implementing Regulations of the 9/11 Commission Act; and other public reports
                required by specific statutory mandates or internal policies of organizations. The
                Senior Agency Official for Privacy consults with legal counsel, where appropriate,
                to ensure that organizations meet all applicable privacy reporting
                requirements.</description>

            <description>An organization-wide supply chain risk management plan includes, for
                example, an unambiguous expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the
                organization, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a
                process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for
                implementing and communicating the supply chain risk management plan, and associated
                roles and responsibilities. The organization-wide supply chain risk management plan
                can be incorporated into the organizations risk management strategy and be used to
                inform the system-level supply chain risk management plan. The use of a risk
                executive function can facilitate consistent, organization-wide application of the
                supply chain risk management plan.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the PS family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>System-related property includes, for example, hardware authentication
                tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and
                building passes. Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the
                security constraints imposed by being former employees and that proper
                accountability is achieved for system-related property. Security topics of interest
                at exit interviews can include, for example, reminding terminated individuals of
                nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit
                interviews may not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in
                cases related to job abandonment, illnesses, and unavailability of supervisors. Exit
                interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution
                of termination actions is essential for individuals terminated for cause. In certain
                situations, organizations consider disabling the system accounts of individuals that
                are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified.</description>

                transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations include, for
                example, returning old and issuing new keys, identification cards, and building
                passes; closing system accounts and establishing new accounts; changing system

            <description>External provider refers to organizations other than the organization
                operating or acquiring the system. External providers include, for example, service
                bureaus, contractors, and other organizations providing system development,
                information technology services, outsourced applications, testing/assessment
                services, and network and security management. Organizations explicitly include
                personnel security requirements in acquisition-related documents. External providers
                may have personnel working at organizational facilities with credentials, badges, or
                system privileges issued by organizations. Notifications of external personnel
                changes ensure appropriate termination of privileges and credentials. Organizations
                define the transfers and terminations deemed reportable by security-related
                characteristics that include, for example, functions, roles, and nature of
                credentials/privileges associated with individuals transferred or
                terminated.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the RA family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective
                security categorization decisions. Security categories describe the potential
                adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals
                if organizational information and systems are comprised through a loss of
                confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Organizations conduct the security
                categorization process as an organization-wide activity with the involvement of
                Chief Information Officers, Senior Agency Information Security Officers, system
                owners, mission and business owners, and information owners/stewards. Organizations
                also consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, in
                accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential
                Directives, potential national-level adverse impacts. Security categorization
                processes facilitate the development of inventories of information assets, and along
                with CM-8, mappings to specific system components where information is processed,
                stored, or transmitted.</description>

                    <description>Conduct a second-level categorization of organizational systems to
                        obtain additional granularity on system impact levels.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>Organizations apply the high water mark concept to each of their
                        systems categorized in accordance with FIPS Publication 199. This process
                        results in systems designated as low impact, moderate impact, or high
                        impact. Organizations desiring additional granularity in the system impact
                        designations for risk-based decision making, can further partition the
                        systems into sub-categories of the initial, first-level system
                        categorization. For example, a second-level categorization on a
                        moderate-impact system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate
                        systems, moderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate systems. This
                        secondary categorization and the resulting sub-categories of the system give
                        organizations an opportunity to further prioritize their investments related
                        to security control selection and the tailoring of control baselines in
                        responding to identified risks. Second-level categorization can also be used
                        to determine those systems that are exceptionally critical to organizational
                        missions and business operations. These systems are sometimes described as
                        high-value assets and thus, organizations may be more focused on complexity,
                        aggregation, and interconnections. Such systems can be identified by
                        partitioning high-impact systems into low-high systems, moderate-high
                        systems, and high-high systems.</description>

            <description>Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective
                risk assessments. Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood,
                and impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
                organizations, and the Nation based on the operation and use of systems. Risk
                assessments also take into account risk from external parties including, for
                example, individuals accessing organizational systems; contractors operating systems
                on behalf of the organization; service providers; and outsourcing entities.
                Organizations can conduct risk assessments, either formal or informal, at all three
                tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business
                process level, or system level) and at any phase in the system development life
                cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps in the Risk
                Management Framework, including categorization, control selection, control
                implementation, control assessment, system authorization, and control monitoring. In
                addition to the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system, risk
                assessments can also address any information related to the system including, for
                example, system design, the intended use of the system, testing results, and other
                supply chain-related information or artifacts. Assessments of risk can play an
                important role in security and privacy control selection processes, particularly
                during the application of tailoring guidance.</description>

                        and therefore, can also adversely impact organizational operations

                overlooked. The vulnerabilities to be scanned need to be readily updated as new
                vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This
                process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified
                and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability analyses for custom software may
                require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary
                analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis
                approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools including, for example,
                web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers.
                Vulnerability scanning includes, for example, scanning for patch levels; scanning
                for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users
                or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating
                information flow control mechanisms. Scanning tools that facilitate interoperability
                include, for example, products that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)
                validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express
                vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention
                and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the
                presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include, for
                example, the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National
                Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments such as red team exercises provide
                additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations
                also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common
                Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).</description>

            <description>Technical surveillance countermeasures surveys are performed by qualified

                surveillance devices and hazards and to identify technical security weaknesses that
                could aid in the conduct of technical penetrations of surveyed facilities. In
                addition, technical surveillance countermeasures surveys provide evaluations of the
                technical security posture of organizations and facilities and include thorough
                visual, electronic, and physical examinations of surveyed facilities, both
                internally and externally. The surveys also provide useful input for organizational
                risk assessments and critical information regarding organizational exposure to
                potential adversaries.</description>

        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Organizations have a variety of options for responding to risk including:
                mitigating the risk by implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls;
                accepting the risk with appropriate justification or rationale; sharing or
                transferring the risk; or rejecting the risk. Organizational risk tolerance
                influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response is also known as risk
                treatment. This control addresses the need to determine an appropriate response to
                risk before a plan of action and milestones entry is generated. For example, the
                response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it may be possible to mitigate the
                risk immediately so a plan of action and milestones entry is not needed. However, if
                the risk response is to mitigate the risk and the mitigation cannot be completed
                immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.</description>

            <description>Privacy impact assessments are an analysis of how information is managed to
                ensure that such management conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy
                requirements regarding privacy; to determine the associated privacy risks and
                effects of creating, collecting, using, processing, storing, maintaining,
                disseminating, disclosing, and disposing of information in identifiable form in a
                system; and to examine and evaluate the protections and alternate processes for
                managing information to mitigate potential privacy concerns. A privacy impact
                assessment is an analysis and a formal document detailing the process and outcome of
                the analysis. To conduct the analysis, organizations use risk assessment processes.
                Although privacy impact assessments may be required by law, organizations may
                develop policies to require privacy impact assessments in circumstances where a
                privacy impact assessment would not be required by law.</description>

            <description>Identify critical system components and functions by performing a
                criticality analysis for [Assignment: organization-defined systems, system
                components, or system services] at [Assignment: organization-defined decision points
                in the system development life cycle].</description>

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require
                significant protections. Criticality analysis is a key tenet of, for example, supply
                chain risk management, and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The
                identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable
                regulations, directives, policies, standards, and guidelines, system functionality
                requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and component
                dependencies. Systems engineers conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of a
                system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional
                decomposition includes the identification of core organizational missions supported
                by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions,
                and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement
                those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within
                and beyond the system boundary. The operational environment of a system or component
                may impact the criticality including, for example, the connections to and
                dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of-systems, and outsourced
                IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system
                components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities
                such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of
                the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational missions
                supported by the system containing those components and functions. A criticality
                analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified,
                or upgraded. If done early in the system life cycle, organizations may consider
                modifying the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and
                functions by, for example, adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system
                design.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the SA family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>A system development life cycle process provides the foundation for the
                successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems. To
                apply the required security and privacy controls within the system development life
                cycle requires a basic understanding of information security and privacy, threats,
                vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions and business
                functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 help individuals properly
                design, code, and test systems and system components. Organizations include
                qualified personnel including, for example, chief information security officers,
                security architects, security engineers, system security officers, and chief privacy
                officers in system development life cycle processes to ensure that established
                security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. It
                is also important that developers include individuals on the development team that
                possess the requisite security and privacy expertise and skills to ensure that the
                needed security and privacy capabilities are effectively integrated into the system.
                Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals having
                key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and
                expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The
                effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise
                architecture also ensures that important security and privacy considerations are
                addressed early in the system life cycle and that those considerations are directly
                related to organizational mission and business processes. This process also
                facilitates the integration of the information security and privacy architectures
                into the enterprise architecture, consistent with risk management strategy of the
                organization. Because the development life cycle of a system involves multiple
                organizations, including, for example, external suppliers, developers, integrators,
                and service providers, it is important to recognize that acquisition and supply
                chain risk management functions and controls play a significant role in the overall
                effective management of the system during that life cycle.</description>

            <description>System components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets
                including, for example, hardware, software, or firmware. These components represent
                the building blocks of a system. System components typically consist of commercial
                information technology products. Security and privacy functional requirements
                include security and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength
                requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include
                degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to tampering or bypass, and
                resistance to direct attack. Security and privacy assurance requirements include
                development processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and the evidence
                from development and assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the
                required security and privacy functionality is implemented and possesses the
                required strength of mechanism. Security and privacy documentation requirements
                address all phases of the system development life cycle. Security and privacy
                requirements are expressed in terms of security and privacy controls and control
                enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. The tailoring
                process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values using
                assignment and selection statements and platform dependencies and implementation
                information. Security and privacy documentation provides user and administrator
                guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security and privacy
                controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the
                security categorization or classification level of the system and the degree to
                which organizations depend on the stated security or privacy capabilities,
                functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations. Security and
                privacy requirements can include mandated configuration settings specifying allowed
                functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for systems, system
                components, and system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for
                any organizational acquisition or procurement.</description>

                        requirements; requirements for trustworthiness and resiliency; and
                        requirements for analysis and testing. Systems can be partitioned into
                        multiple subsystems. Each subsystem within the system can contain one or
                        more modules. The high-level design for the system is expressed in terms of
                        subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing security-relevant

                    <description>Require the developer of the system, system component, or system
                        service to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and services intended

                    <description>The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services
                        early in the system development life cycle, for example, during the initial
                        requirements definition and design phases, allows organizations to influence
                        the design of the system, system component, or system service. This early
                        involvement in the system life cycle helps organizations to avoid or
                        minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose
                        unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking
                        specific ports, protocols, or services or when requiring system service
                        providers to do so. Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and
                        services avoids costly retrofitting of controls after the system, component,
                        or system service has been implemented. SA-9 describes the requirements for
                        external system services with organizations identifying which functions,
                        ports, protocols, and services are provided from external
                        sources.</description>

            <description>This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation
                and operation of security and privacy controls associated with systems, system
                components, and system services. Organizations consider establishing specific
                measures to determine the quality and completeness of the content provided. System
                documentation may be used, for example, to support the management of supply chain
                risk, incident response, and other functions. Personnel or roles requiring
                documentation may include, for example, system owners, system security officers, and
                system administrators. Attempts to obtain documentation may include, for example,
                directly contacting manufacturers or suppliers and conducting web-based searches.
                The inability to obtain needed documentation may occur, for example, due to the age
                of the system or component or lack of support from developers and contractors. In
                those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected documentation if such
                documentation is essential to the implementation or operation of the security and
                privacy controls. The level of protection provided for the system, component, or
                service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification
                of the system. Documentation that addresses system vulnerabilities may require an
                increased level of protection. Secure operation of the system, includes, for
                example, initially starting the system and resuming secure system operation after
                any lapse in system operation.</description>

        <statement>
            <description>Apply [Assignment: organization-defined systems security engineering
                principles] in the specification, design, development, implementation, and
                modification of the system and system components.</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Organizations can apply systems security and privacy engineering principles
                to new systems under development or to systems undergoing upgrades. For legacy
                systems, organizations apply systems security and privacy engineering principles to
                system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of
                hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems. The application of
                systems security and privacy engineering concepts and principles help to develop
                trustworthy, secure systems and system components and reduce the susceptibility of
                organizations to disruptions, hazards, threats, and creating privacy-related
                problems for individuals. Examples of these concepts and principles include,
                developing layered protections; establishing security and privacy policies,
                architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development;
                incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development life
                cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that
                developers are trained on how to build secure software; tailoring security and
                privacy controls to meet organizational and operational needs; performing threat
                modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design
                patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk. Organizations that
                apply security and privacy engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the
                development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services;
                reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk management decisions.
                Security engineering principles can also be used to protect against certain supply
                chain risks including, for example, incorporating tamper-resistant hardware into a
                design.</description>

            <description>External system services are those services that are implemented external
                to authorization boundaries of organizational systems. This includes services that
                are used by, but not a part of, organizational systems. Organizations establish
                relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways including, for
                example, through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of
                business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain
                exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system
                services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations,
                a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a level of
                confidence that each provider in the consumer-provider relationship provides
                adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain
                of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations and the external
                providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the
                relationships can be monitored over time. External system services documentation
                includes government, service providers, end user security roles and
                responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define
                expectations of performance for implemented security and privacy controls; describe
                measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified
                instances of noncompliance.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services
                        is at an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in
                        the external providers, individually or in combination. Trust relationships
                        can help organizations to gain increased levels of confidence that
                        participating service providers are providing adequate protection for the
                        services rendered. They can also be useful when conducting incident response
                        or when planning for upgrades or obsolescence. Trust relationships can be
                        complicated due to the number of potential entities participating in the
                        consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of
                        trust, and types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the
                        degree of trust is based on the level of control organizations can exert on
                        external service providers regarding the controls necessary for the
                        protection of the service, information, or individual privacy and the
                        evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of the implemented controls.
                        The level of control is established by the terms and conditions of the
                        contracts or service-level agreements. Extensive control may include
                        negotiating contracts or agreements that specify security and privacy
                        requirements for providers. Limited control may include using contracts or
                        service-level agreements to obtain commodity services such as commercial
                        telecommunications services.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>As organizations increasingly use external service providers, it is
                        possible that the interests of the service providers may diverge from
                        organizational interests. In such situations, simply having the required
                        technical, management, or operational controls in place may not be
                        sufficient if the providers that implement and manage those controls are not
                        operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming
                        organizations. The actions that organizations might take to address such
                        concerns include, for example, requiring background checks for selected
                        service provider personnel; examining ownership records; employing only
                        trustworthy service providers, including providers with which organizations
                        have had successful trust relationships; and conducting routine periodic,

                        storage, or system services that are critical to organizations can have a
                        direct impact on the ability of those organizations to successfully execute
                        their missions and business functions. This occurs when external providers
                        control the location of processing, storage, or services. The criteria that
                        external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service
                        locations may be different from the criteria organizations use. For example,
                        organizations may desire that data or information storage locations are
                        restricted to certain locations to help facilitate incident response
                        activities in case of information security or privacy incidents. Such
                        incident response activities including, for example, forensic analyses and
                        after-the-fact investigations, may be adversely affected by the governing
                        laws or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur and/or

                        the external system or through use of a component that permits encryption

            <description>Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the configuration
                management activities conducted by developers as direct evidence of applying
                effective security controls. Controls include, for example, protecting from
                unauthorized modification or destruction, the master copies of material used to
                generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware.
                Maintaining the integrity of changes to the system, system component, or system
                service requires strict configuration control throughout the system development life
                cycle to track authorized changes and to prevent unauthorized changes. The
                configuration items that are placed under configuration management include: the
                formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other
                design data; implementation documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the
                current running version of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of
                security-relevant hardware descriptions and source code with previous versions; and
                test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission and business needs of
                organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers
                may provide configuration management support during the operations and maintenance
                phases of the system life cycle.</description>

            <description>Developmental testing and evaluation confirms that the required security
                and privacy controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the
                desired security and privacy policies, and meeting established security and privacy
                requirements. Security properties of systems and the privacy of individuals may be
                affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components.
                These interconnections or changes including, for example, upgrading or replacing
                applications, operating systems, and firmware, may adversely affect previously
                implemented security and privacy controls. This control provides additional types of
                testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential
                flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as static
                analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches.
                Developers can use these analysis approaches in a variety of tools and in source
                code reviews. Security and privacy assessment plans provide the specific activities
                that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing,
                evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to
                be applied, and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of
                testing and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the
                assessment process. The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the scope
                (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process.
                Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security and privacy assessment plans,
                flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans and processes have been
                diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence,
                and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification
                level of the system. Contracts may specify documentation protection
                requirements.</description>

                        service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and

                    <description>Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for
                        security reviews and may include, for example, checking for weaknesses in
                        the code and checking for incorporation of libraries or other included code
                        with known vulnerabilities or that are out-of-date and not supported. Such
                        analysis can be used to identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding
                        practices. Static code analysis is most effective when used early in the
                        development process, when each code change can be automatically scanned for
                        potential weaknesses. Static analysis can provide clear remediation guidance
                        along with defects to enable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of
                        correct implementation of static analysis can include, for example,
                        aggregate defect density for critical defect types; evidence that defects
                        were inspected by developers or security professionals; and evidence that
                        defects were remediated. An excessively high density of ignored findings,
                        commonly referred to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with
                        the analysis process or the analysis tool. In such cases, organizations
                        weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other
                        sources.</description>

                    <description>Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which
                        assessors, using all available information technology product or system
                        documentation and working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent
                        implemented security and privacy features of information technology products
                        and systems. Useful information for assessors conducting penetration testing
                        can include, for example, product and system design specifications, source
                        code, and administrator and operator manuals. Penetration testing can
                        include white-box, gray-box, or black box testing with associated analyses
                        performed by skilled professionals simulating adversary actions. The
                        objective of penetration testing is to uncover the potential vulnerabilities
                        in systems, system components and services resulting from implementation
                        errors, configuration faults, or other operational weaknesses or
                        deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with
                        automated and manual code reviews to provide greater levels of analysis than
                        would ordinarily be possible.</description>

                    <description>Dynamic code analysis provides run-time verification of software
                        programs, using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption,
                        user privilege issues, and other potential security problems. Dynamic code
                        analysis employs run-time tools to ensure that security functionality
                        performs in the way it was designed. A specialized type of dynamic analysis,
                        known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by deliberately introducing
                        malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies
                        derive from the intended use of applications and the associated functional
                        and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of
                        dynamic code analysis and hence the assurance provided, organizations may

            <description>Supply chain-related events including, for example, disruption, theft,
                insertion of counterfeits, insertion of malicious code, malicious development
                practices, improper delivery practices, and use of defective components, can
                adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information
                processed, stored, or transmitted by a system. Such events can also adversely impact
                organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation),
                organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Supply
                chain-related events may be unintentional or malicious and occur at any point during
                the system life cycle. Managing supply chain risks involves gaining visibility and
                understanding of the processes and procedures used to protect the system, system
                component, or system service throughout the system life cycle. This allows
                organizations to make appropriate acquisition decisions and to identify appropriate
                mitigation strategies. A supply chain risk management plan includes, for example, an
                unambiguous expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the system, acceptable
                supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a description of and
                justification for supply chain protection measures taken, a process for consistently
                evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and
                communicating the supply chain risk management plan, and associated roles and

                    <description>The use of the acquisition process early in the system development
                        life cycle provides an important vehicle to protect the supply chain. There
                        are many useful tools and techniques available including, for example,
                        obscuring the end use of a system or system component, using blind or
                        filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or
                        controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can
                        inform which strategies, tools, and methods are most applicable to the
                        situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against the
                        insertion of counterfeits, tampering, theft, unauthorized production,
                        insertion of malicious software, as well as poor manufacturing and
                        development practices throughout the system development life cycle.
                        Organizations also consider creating incentives for suppliers who implement
                        security and privacy controls; promote transparency into their
                        organizational processes and security and privacy practices; provide

                    <description>A review of supplier risk may include, for example, the ability of
                        the supplier to effectively assess or vet any subordinate second-tier and
                        third-tier suppliers and contractors. These reviews may be conducted by the
                        organization or by an independent third party. The reviews consider
                        documented processes, documented controls, publicly available information
                        related to the supplier or contractor, and all-source intelligence where

                    <description>Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is
                        critical to gaining visibility into what is happening within such supply
                        chains. It is also important for monitoring and identifying high-risk events
                        and activities. Without reasonable visibility and traceability into supply
                        chains (i.e., elements, processes, and personnel), it is very difficult for
                        organizations to understand, and therefore manage risk, and ultimately
                        reduce the likelihood of or susceptibility to adverse events. Supply chain
                        elements are systems or system components that contain programmable logic
                        and that are critically important to system functions. Supply chain
                        processes include, for example, hardware, software, and firmware development
                        processes; shipping and handling procedures; personnel and physical security
                        programs; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to
                        maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated
                        with the production and distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain
                        personnel are individuals in the supply chain with specific roles and
                        responsibilities related to, for example, the secure development, delivery,
                        maintenance, and disposal of a system or system component. Tracking the
                        unique identifiers of supply chain elements, processes, and personnel
                        establishes a foundational identity structure for assessment of supply chain
                        activities and for the establishment and maintenance of provenance. For
                        example, supply chain elements may be labeled using serial numbers or tagged
                        using radio-frequency identification tags. These labels and tags can help
                        provide the organization better visibility into the provenance of that
                        element. Identification methods are sufficient to support a forensic
                        investigation in the event of a supply chain compromise or
                        event.</description>

                        changed throughout its existence. Provenance is the chronology of the
                        origin, development, ownership, location, and changes to a system or system
                        component and associated data. It may also include personnel and processes
                        used to interact with or make modifications to the system, component, or
                        associated data. Organizations consider developing procedures for allocating
                        responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance
                        for systems and components; transferring provenance documentation and
                        responsibility between organizations; and preventing and monitoring for
                        unauthorized changes to the provenance records. Organizations consider
                        developing methods to document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance
                        baselines for systems, system components, and related data. Such actions
                        help track, assess, and document changes to the provenance, including
                        changes in supply chain elements or configuration, and ensure
                        non-repudiation of provenance information and the provenance change

                    <description>Organizations use quality metrics to establish acceptable levels of
                        system quality. Metrics may include quality gates which are collections of
                        completion criteria or sufficiency standards representing the satisfactory
                        execution of specific phases of the system development project. A quality
                        gate, for example, may require the elimination of all compiler warnings or a
                        determination that such warnings have no impact on the effectiveness of
                        required security or privacy capabilities. During the execution phases of
                        development projects, quality gates provide clear, unambiguous indications
                        of progress. Other metrics apply to the entire development project. These

                    <description>Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with developer threat
                        and vulnerability analyses and system architecture and design. Attack
                        surface reduction is a means of reducing risk to organizations by giving
                        attackers less opportunity to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e.,
                        potential vulnerabilities) within systems, system components, and system
                        services. Attack surface reduction includes, for example, employing the
                        concept of layered defenses; applying the principles of least privilege and
                        least functionality; deprecating unsafe functions; applying secure software
                        development practices including, for example, reducing the amount of code
                        executing and reducing entry points available to unauthorized users; and
                        eliminating application programming interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable to
                        attacks.</description>

                    <description>Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through
                        modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate

                        details that are present have no impact on the behaviors or policies being
                        modeled. Formal methods can be used to show that the high-level security
                        properties are satisfied by the formal system description, and that the
                        formal system description is correctly implemented by a description of some
                        lower level, for example a hardware description. Consistency between the
                        formal top-level specification and the formal policy models is generally not
                        amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal and
                        informal methods may be needed to show such consistency. Consistency between
                        the formal top-level specification and the actual implementation may require
                        the use of an informal demonstration due to limitations in the applicability
                        of formal methods to prove that the specification accurately reflects the

            <description>Re-implement or custom develops [Assignment: organization-defined critical
                system components].</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Organizations determine that certain system components likely cannot be
                trusted due to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components, and for
                which there are no viable security controls to adequately mitigate the resulting
                risk. Re-implementation or custom development of such components helps to satisfy
                requirements for higher assurance. This is accomplished by initiating changes to
                system components (including hardware, software, and firmware) such that the
                standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations where no
                alternative sourcing is available and organizations choose not to re-implement or
                custom develop critical system components, additional safeguards can be employed.
                These include, for example, enhanced auditing; restrictions on source code and
                system utility access; and protection from deletion of system and application
                files.</description>

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>This control is directed at external developers. Because the system, system
                component, or system service may be employed in critical activities essential to the
                national or economic security interests of the United States, organizations have a
                strong interest in ensuring that the developer is trustworthy. The degree of trust
                required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the individuals
                accessing the system/component/service once deployed. Examples of authorization and
                personnel screening criteria include clearances, background checks, citizenship, and
                nationality. Trustworthiness of developers may also include a review and analysis of
                company ownership and any relationships the company has with entities potentially
                affecting the quality and reliability of the systems, components, or services being
                developed. Satisfying required access authorizations and personnel screening
                criteria includes, for example, providing a list of all individuals who are
                authorized to perform development activities on the selected system, system
                component, or system service so that organizations can validate that the developer
                has satisfied the authorization and screening requirements.</description>

                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and plans or in one or more separate documents.
                It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute an
                organizational policy or procedure.</description>

        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>System management functionality includes, for example, functions that are
                necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers.
                These functions typically require privileged user access. The separation of user
                functions from system management functions is either physical or logical.
                Organizations implement separation of system management functions from user
                functions, for example, by using different computers, instances of operating
                systems, central processing units, or network addresses; by employing virtualization
                techniques; or some combination of these or other methods. This type of separation
                includes, for example, web administrative interfaces that use separate
                authentication methods for users of any other system resources. Separation of system
                and user functions may include isolating administrative interfaces on different
                domains and with additional access controls.</description>

        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>The system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions by means
                of an isolation boundary implemented via partitions and domains. Such isolation
                controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and
                firmware that perform those security functions. Systems implement code separation in
                many ways, for example, through the provision of security kernels via processor
                rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often
                achieved through file system protections that protect the code on disk and address
                space protections that protect executing code. Systems can restrict access to
                security functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least
                privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all code within the defined security
                function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes
                necessary to include nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundary as an
                exception.</description>

                    <description>In those instances where it is not feasible to achieve strict
                        isolation of nonsecurity functions from security functions, it is necessary
                        to take actions to minimize the nonsecurity-relevant functions within the
                        security function boundary. Nonsecurity functions contained within the
                        isolation boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or the
                        maliciousness in such software, can directly impact the security functions
                        of systems. The fundamental design objective is that the specific portions
                        of systems providing information security are of minimal size and
                        complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity functions in the
                        security-relevant system components allows designers and implementers to
                        focus only on those functions which are necessary to provide the desired
                        security capability (typically access enforcement). By minimizing
                        nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundaries, the amount of code
                        that must be trusted to enforce security policies is significantly reduced,

                    <description>The reduction in inter-module interactions helps to constrain

                        Coupling refers to the dependencies that one module has on other modules.
                        Cohesion refers to the relationship between different functions within a
                        module. Best practices in software engineering rely on layering,
                        minimization, and modular decomposition to reduce and manage complexity.
                        This produces software modules that are highly cohesive and loosely

                <title>PREVENT SPLIT TUNNELING FOR REMOTE DEVICES</title>
                <statement>
                    <description>Prevent a remote device from simultaneously establishing non-remote
                        connections with the system and communicating via some other connection to
                        resources in external networks.</description>
                </statement>
                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>This control enhancement is implemented in remote devices
                        including, for example, notebook computers, through configuration settings
                        to disable split tunneling in those devices, and by preventing those
                        configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This
                        control enhancement is implemented within the system by the detection of
                        split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in
                        the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is
                        using split tunneling. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to
                        communicate with local system resources such as printers or file servers.
                        However, split tunneling can allow unauthorized external connections, making
                        the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational
                        information. The use of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately
                        provisioned with the appropriate security controls, may provide the
                        organization with sufficient assurance that it can effectively treat such
                        connections as non-remote connections with respect to the objectives of
                        confidentiality and integrity. VPNs provide a means for allowing non-remote
                        communications paths from remote devices. The use of an adequately
                        provisioned VPN does not eliminate the need for preventing split
                        tunneling.</description>

                    <description>External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A
                        proxy server is a server (i.e., system or application) that acts as an
                        intermediary for clients requesting system resources from non-organizational
                        or other organizational servers. These system resources can include, for
                        example, files, connections, web pages, or services. Client requests
                        established through an initial connection to the proxy server are evaluated
                        to manage complexity and to provide additional protection by limiting direct
                        connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy
                        servers providing access to the Internet. Proxy servers can support logging
                        of individual Transmission Control Protocol sessions and blocking specific
                        Uniform Resource Locators, Internet Protocol addresses, and domain names.
                        Web proxies can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized
                        and unauthorized websites.</description>

                    <description>This control enhancement applies to intentional and unintentional
                        exfiltration of information. Safeguards to prevent exfiltration of
                        information from systems may be implemented at internal endpoints, external
                        boundaries, and across managed interfaces and include, for example, strict
                        adherence to protocol formats; monitoring for beaconing activity from
                        systems; monitoring for steganography; disconnecting external network
                        interfaces except when explicitly needed; disassembling and reassembling
                        packet headers; employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from
                        the volume and types of traffic expected within organizations or call backs
                        to command and control centers; and implementing data loss and data leakage
                        prevention tools. Devices that enforce strict adherence to protocol formats
                        include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways.
                        These devices verify adherence to protocol formats and specifications at the
                        application layer and identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by
                        devices operating at the network or transport layers. This control
                        enhancement is analogous with data loss/data leakage prevention and is
                        closely associated with cross-domain solutions and system guards enforcing
                        information flow requirements.</description>

                    <description>Organizations can isolate system components performing different
                        missions or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized
                        information flows among system components and provides the opportunity to
                        deploy greater levels of protection for selected system components.
                        Separating system components with boundary protection mechanisms provides
                        the capability for increased protection of individual components and to more
                        effectively control information flows between those components. This type of
                        enhanced protection limits the potential harm from hostile attacks and
                        errors. The degree of separation provided varies depending upon the
                        mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms include, for example,
                        routers, gateways, and firewalls separating system components into
                        physically separate networks or subnetworks; cross-domain devices separating

                computers, desktop computers, mobile devices, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile
                machines, and radios. Unprotected communication paths are exposed to the possibility
                of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of
                information can be accomplished by physical means or by logical means. Physical
                protection can be achieved by employing protected distribution systems. Logical

            <description>Trusted paths are mechanisms by which users (through input devices) can
                communicate directly with security functions of systems with the requisite assurance
                to support security policies. These mechanisms can be activated only by users or the
                security functions of organizational systems. User responses via trusted paths are
                protected from modifications by or disclosure to untrusted applications.
                Organizations employ trusted paths for trustworthy, high-assurance connections
                between security functions of systems and users including, for example, during
                system logons. The original implementations of trusted path used an out-of-band
                signal to initiate the path, for example using the &lt;BREAK&gt; key, which does not
                transmit characters that can be spoofed. In later implementations, a key combination
                that could not be hijacked was used, for example, the &lt;CTRL&gt; + &lt;ALT&gt; +
                &lt;DEL&gt; keys. Note, however, that any such key combinations are
                platform-specific and may not provide a trusted path implementation in every case.
                Enforcement of trusted communications paths is typically provided by a specific
                implementation that meets the reference monitor concept.</description>

        <title>CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION</title>
        <statement>
            <description>Implement the following cryptographic uses and type of cryptography for
                each use: [Assignment: organization-defined cryptographic uses and type of
                cryptography required for each use].</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions
                including, for example, the protection of classified information and Controlled
                Unclassified Information; the provision and implementation of digital signatures;
                and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the
                necessary clearances but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography
                can also be used to support random number generation and hash generation. Generally
                applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and
                NSA-approved cryptography. This control does not impose any requirements on
                organizations to use cryptography. However, if cryptography is required due to the
                selection of other security controls, organizations define each type of
                cryptographic use and the type of cryptography required. For example, organizations
                that need to protect classified information specify the use of NSA-approved
                cryptography. Organizations that need to provision and implement digital signatures
                specify the use of FIPS-validated cryptography. In all instances, cryptography is
                implemented in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
                policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.</description>

            <description>Decisions regarding the use of mobile code within organizational systems
                are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used
                maliciously. Mobile code technologies include, for example, Java, JavaScript,
                ActiveX, Postscript, PDF, Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and VBScript. Usage
                restrictions and implementation guidelines apply to both the selection and use of
                mobile code installed on servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on
                individual workstations and devices including, for example, notebook computers and
                smart phones. Mobile code policy and procedures address the specific actions taken
                to prevent the development, acquisition, and introduction of unacceptable mobile
                code within organizational systems.</description>

        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Systems that provide name and address resolution services include, for
                example, domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure and
                to enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name
                system servers; one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the
                secondary server. Additionally, organizations typically deploy the servers in two
                geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical
                facility). For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only process name
                and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from internal
                clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution
                information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external
                networks including the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access
                authoritative DNS servers in certain roles, for example, by address ranges and
                explicit lists.</description>

            <description>Protect the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of
                [Assignment: organization-defined information] at rest.</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>This control addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information at
                rest and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers
                to the state of information when it is not in process or in transit and is located
                on storage devices as specific components of systems. The focus of this control is
                not on the type of storage device or frequency of access but rather the state of the
                information. System-related information requiring protection includes, for example,
                configurations or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection and
                prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may
                employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections,
                including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity
                protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM)
                technologies. When adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be
                achieved, organizations may employ other security controls including, for example,
                frequent scanning to identify malicious code at rest and secure off-line storage in
                lieu of online storage.</description>

                        components in operational environments including, for example, portable
                        storage devices, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Selection of
                        cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality
                        and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is
                        commensurate with the security category or classification of the
                        information. Organizations have the flexibility to encrypt all information

                        example, files, records, or fields. Organizations employing cryptographic

            <description>Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational
                systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations or compromises of specific
                technologies. Such diversity protects against common mode failures, including those
                failures induced by supply chain attacks. Diversity in information technologies also
                reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to compromise one system
                component will be equally effective against other system components, thus further
                increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned attacks. An
                increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead which could
                ultimately lead to mistakes and unauthorized configurations.</description>

                techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined systems] at [Assignment:
                organization-defined time-periods] to confuse and mislead adversaries.</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the
                targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available
                attack surface) to initiate and complete attacks. For example, virtualization
                techniques provide organizations with the ability to disguise systems, potentially
                reducing the likelihood of successful attacks without the cost of having multiple
                platforms. Increased use of concealment and misdirection techniques and methods
                including, for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may
                sufficiently confuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of
                discovery and/or exposing tradecraft. Concealment and misdirection techniques may
                also provide organizations additional time to successfully perform core missions and
                business functions. Because of the time and effort required to support concealment
                and misdirection techniques, it is anticipated that such techniques would be used by
                organizations on a very limited basis.</description>

                    <description>Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for
                        adversaries regarding the actions organizations take in defending their
                        systems against attacks. Such actions may impede the ability of adversaries
                        to correctly target information resources of organizations supporting
                        critical missions or business functions. Uncertainty may also cause
                        adversaries to hesitate before initiating or continuing their attacks.
                        Misdirection techniques involving randomness include, for example,
                        performing certain routine actions at different times of day, employing

                    <description>Adversaries target critical missions and business functions and the
                        systems supporting those missions and functions while at the same time,
                        trying to minimize exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static,
                        homogeneous, and deterministic nature of organizational systems targeted by
                        adversaries, make such systems more susceptible to attacks with less
                        adversary cost and effort to be successful. Changing processing and storage
                        locations (sometimes referred to as moving target defense) addresses the
                        advanced persistent threat (APT) using techniques such as virtualization,
                        distributed processing, and replication. This enables organizations to
                        relocate the system components (i.e., processing and/or storage) supporting
                        critical missions and business functions. Changing the locations of
                        processing activities and/or storage sites introduces a degree of
                        uncertainty into the targeting activities by adversaries. This uncertainty
                        increases the work factor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to
                        organizational systems much more difficult and time-consuming. It also
                        increases the chances that adversaries may inadvertently disclose aspects of
                        tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational
                        resources.</description>

                        One way of misleading adversaries is for organizations to place misleading

                hosts applications, for example, operating systems, executives, or monitors
                including virtual machine monitors (i.e., hypervisors). It can also include certain
                applications running directly on hardware platforms. Hardware-enforced, read-only
                media include, for example, Compact Disk-Recordable (CD-R) and Digital Video
                Disk-Recordable (DVD-R) disk drives and one-time programmable read-only memory. The
                use of non-modifiable storage ensures the integrity of software from the point of
                creation of the read-only image. The use of reprogrammable read-only memory can be
                accepted as read-only media provided integrity can be adequately protected from the
                point of initial writing to the insertion of the memory into the system; and there
                are reliable hardware protections against reprogramming the memory while installed

        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Out-of-band channels include, for example, local nonnetwork accesses to
                systems; network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational
                traffic; or nonelectronic paths such as the US Postal Service. This is in contrast
                with using the same channels (i.e., in-band channels) that carry routine operational
                traffic. Out-of-band channels do not have the same vulnerability or exposure as
                in-band channels, and therefore, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability
                compromises of in-band channels will not compromise or adversely affect the
                out-of-band channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery
                or transmission of many organizational items including, for example, identifiers and
                authenticators; cryptographic key management information; configuration management

        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential
                adversaries can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of
                organizations by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified
                information that specifically relates to the planning and execution of sensitive
                organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves five steps: identification of
                critical information; analysis of threats; analysis of vulnerabilities; assessment
                of risks; and the application of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC safeguards are
                applied to organizational systems and the environments in which those systems
                operate. OPSEC safeguards protect the confidentiality of key information including,
                for example, limiting the sharing of information with suppliers and potential
                suppliers of system components and services, and with other non-organizational
                elements and individuals. Information critical to organizational mission and
                business success includes, for example, user identities, element uses, suppliers,
                supply chain processes, functional and security requirements, system design
                specifications, testing and evaluation protocols, and security control

        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process
                by assigning each process a separate address space. Each system process has a
                distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a
                manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the
                executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains for
                executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing separate address
                spaces. This capability is readily available in most commercial operating systems
                that employ multi-state processor technologies.</description>

            <description>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
                effective implementation of the controls and control enhancements in the SI family.
                The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing policy and
                procedures. Comprehensive policy and procedures help provide security and privacy
                assurance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization
                level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
                policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or can be
                represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. The
                procedures can be established for security and privacy programs and for systems, if
                needed. Procedures describe how policies or controls are implemented and can be
                directed at the personnel or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures
                can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
                documents. It is important to recognize that restating controls does not constitute
                an organizational policy or procedure.</description>

            <description>Organizations identify systems affected by software flaws including
                potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this information to
                designated organizational personnel with information security and privacy
                responsibilities. Security-relevant software updates include, for example, patches,
                service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations also address
                flaws discovered during assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response
                activities, and system error handling. By incorporating flaw remediation into
                ongoing configuration management processes, required remediation actions can be
                tracked and verified. Organization-defined time-periods for updating
                security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors
                including, for example, the security category of the system or the criticality of
                the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).
                Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types.
                Organizations determine the type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw
                remediation activity under consideration and the types of changes that are to be
                configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine that testing
                of software or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, for example, when
                implementing simple anti-virus signature updates. Organizations also consider in
                testing decisions, whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are
                obtained from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures.</description>

            <description>System entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, remote-access
                servers, workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, notebook
                computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms,
                Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats
                contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques
                such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of
                ways including, for example, by electronic mail, the world-wide web, and portable
                storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system
                vulnerabilities. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate
                the effects of malicious code. Malicious code protection mechanisms include, for
                example, signature- and nonsignature-based technologies. Nonsignature-based
                detection mechanisms include, for example, artificial intelligence techniques that
                use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of
                malicious code and to provide safeguards against such code for which signatures do
                not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. This includes
                polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates).
                Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies. In
                addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management,
                comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be
                effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be
                present in commercial off-the-shelf software and in custom-built software. This
                could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of attacks that
                could affect organizational missions and business functions. In situations where
                malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods and technologies,
                organizations rely instead on other types of safeguards including, for example,
                secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement
                processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform
                functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in
                response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For
                example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection
                during periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, or
                actions in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute
                files. Due to system integrity and availability concerns, organizations consider the
                specific methodology used to carry out automatic updates.</description>

            <description>System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External
                monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at system boundaries.
                Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system.
                Organizations monitor systems, for example, by observing audit activities in real
                time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics
                of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives guide and inform the
                determination of the events. System monitoring capability is achieved through a
                variety of tools and techniques, including, for example, intrusion detection
                systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning
                tools, audit record monitoring software, and network monitoring software. The
                distribution and configuration of monitoring devices can impact throughput at key
                internal and external boundaries, and at other locations across a network due to the
                introduction of network throughput latency. Therefore, such devices are
                strategically located and deployed as part of an established organization-wide
                security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for
                example, selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms
                supporting critical applications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the
                managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information
                collected is a function of the organizational monitoring objectives and the
                capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of
                interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that
                bypasses HTTP proxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational
                continuous monitoring and incident response programs and output from system
                monitoring serves as input to those programs. Adjustments to levels of system
                monitoring are based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or
                other credible sources of information. The legality of system monitoring activities
                is based on applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies,
                standards, and guidelines.</description>

                    <description>Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from
                        intrusions that are identified on organizational systems at the host or
                        network level. IOCs provide valuable information on systems that have been
                        compromised. IOCs for the discovery of compromised hosts can include, for
                        example, the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic
                        include, for example, Universal Resource Locator or protocol elements that
                        indicate malicious code command and control servers. The rapid distribution
                        and adoption of IOCs can improve information security by reducing the time

            <description>The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) generates
                security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal
                government. Security directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations
                with the responsibility and authority to issue such directives. Compliance to
                security directives is essential due to the critical nature of many of these
                directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational operations
                and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives
                not be implemented in a timely manner. External organizations include, for example,
                external mission or business partners, supply chain partners, external service
                providers, and other peer or supporting organizations.</description>

                    <description>Unauthorized modifications to boot firmware may be indicative of a
                        sophisticated, targeted attack. These types of targeted attacks can result
                        in a permanent denial of service or a persistent malicious code presence.
                        These situations can occur, for example, if the firmware is corrupted or if
                        the malicious code is embedded within the firmware. System components can
                        protect the integrity of boot firmware in organizational systems by
                        verifying the integrity and authenticity of all updates to the firmware
                        prior to applying changes to the system component; and preventing
                        unauthorized processes from modifying the boot firmware.</description>

            <description>Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs including, for
                example, character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values, verifies
                that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software
                applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages
                (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system
                components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed
                with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied
                inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages,
                then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can
                cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently,
                the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong
                operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to
                passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted
                as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevent
                attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection
                attacks.</description>

                    <description>In addressing invalid system inputs received across protocol
                        interfaces, timing interactions become relevant, where one protocol needs to
                        consider the impact of the error response on other protocols within the
                        protocol stack. For example, 802.11 standard wireless network protocols do
                        not interact well with Transmission Control Protocols (TCP) when packets are
                        dropped (which could be due to invalid packet input). TCP assumes packet
                        losses are due to congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are
                        typically dropped due to collisions or noise on the link. If TCP makes a
                        congestion response, it takes the wrong action in response to a collision
                        event. Adversaries may be able to use what appears to be acceptable
                        individual behaviors of the protocols in concert to achieve adverse effects
                        through suitable construction of invalid input.</description>

        <statement>
            <description>Implement non-persistent [Assignment: organization-defined system
                components and services] that are initiated in a known state and terminated
                [Selection (one or more): upon end of session of use; periodically at [Assignment:
                organization-defined frequency]].</description>
        </statement>
        <supplemental-guidance>
            <description>This control mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by
                significantly reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of
                opportunity and available attack surface) to initiate and complete attacks. By
                implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components,
                organizations can provide a known state computing resource for a specific
                time-period that does not give adversaries sufficient time on target to exploit
                vulnerabilities in organizational systems and the environments in which those
                systems operate. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat regarding
                capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended
                period, a percentage of attacks will be successful. Non-persistent system components
                and services are activated as required using protected information and terminated
                periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of
                adversaries in attempting to compromise or breach organizational systems.
                Non-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, for example, by
                periodically re-imaging components or by using a variety of common virtualization
                techniques. Non-persistent services can be implemented using virtualization
                techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances of processes on physical
                machines (either persistent or non-persistent). The benefit of periodic refreshes of
                system components and services is that it does not require organizations to first
                determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something
                that may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components
                and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended
                impact of attacks, but not with such frequency that it makes the system unstable.
                Refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically to hinder the
                ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities.</description>

                medical, educational, financial, and employment information. Personally identifiable
                information is removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is
                not (or no longer) necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data.
                For example, if the dataset is only used to produce aggregate statistics, the
                identifiers that are not needed for producing those statistics are removed. Removing
                identifiers improves privacy protection, since information that is removed cannot be
                inadvertently disclosed or improperly used.</description>

                        the information will not be used, the dataset can be de-identified upon
                        creation by simply not collecting the data elements containing the
                        personally identifiable information. For example, if an organization does
                        not intend to use the social security number of an applicant, then
                        application forms do not ask for a social security number.</description>

                    <description>Remove, mask, encrypt, hash, or replace direct identifiers in a
                        dataset.</description>

                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>There are many possible processes for removing direct identifiers
                        from a dataset. Columns in a dataset that contain a direct identifier can be
                        removed. In masking, the direct identifier is transformed into a repeating
                        character, for example, XXXXXX or 999999. Identifiers can be encrypted or
                        hashed, so that the linked records remain linked. In the case of encryption
                        or hashing, algorithms are employed that require the use of a key,
                        including, for example, the Advanced Encryption Standard or a Hash-based
                        Message Authentication Code. Implementations may use the same key for all
                        identifiers or a different key for each identifier. Using a different key
                        for each identifier provides for a higher degree of security and privacy.
                        Identifiers can alternatively be replaced with a keyword, including for
                        example, transforming George Washington to PATIENT, or replaced with a
                        realistic surrogate value, including for example, transforming George
                        Washington to Abraham Polk.</description>

                        For example, if a school publishes a monthly table with the number of

                        students, but in March it reports that it has 20-29 such students, then it
                        can be inferred that the student who enrolled in February was a

                        non-deterministic noise to the results of mathematical operations before the

                </statement>
                <supplemental-guidance>
                    <description>The mathematical definition for differential privacy holds that the
                        result of a dataset analysis should be approximately the same before and
                        after the addition or removal of a single data record (which is assumed to
                        be the data from a single individual). In its most basic form, differential
                        privacy applies only to online query systems. However, it can also be used
                        to produce machine-learning statistical classifiers and synthetic data.
                        Differential privacy comes at the cost of decreased accuracy of results,
                        forcing organizations to quantify the trade-off between privacy protection
                        and the overall accuracy, usefulness, and utility of the de-identified
                        dataset. Non-deterministic noise can include, for example, adding small
                        random values to the results of mathematical operations in dataset
                        analysis.</description>

                    <description>Algorithms that appear to remove personally identifiable
                        information from a dataset may in fact leave information that is personally

                    <description>A motivated intruder test is a test in which a person or group
                        takes a data release and specified resources and attempts to re-identify one
                        or more individuals in the de-identified dataset. Such tests specify the
                        amount of inside knowledge, financial resources, computational resources,
                        data, and skills that intruders have at their disposal to conduct the tests.
                        A motivated intruder test can identify if de-identification is insufficient.
                        It can also be a useful diagnostic tool to assess if de-identification is
                        likely to be sufficient; however, the test alone cannot prove that
                        de-identification is sufficient.</description>
