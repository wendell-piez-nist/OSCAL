description: Standardized processes to be applied to OSCAL data

OSCAL data is intended to be processed in many ways for many different purposes. The specifications here describe normative processes, in the sense that all OSCAL processors that perform these operations should produce the same outputs from the same inputs under the same configuration. However, users and developers should find many ways to take advantage of data encoded in OSCAL, even beyond what is considered here.
