Opinion is often muddled or extrapolated from limited experience: \u201cX is lightweight\u201d, \u201cY is \u2018self-describing\u2019\u201d, \u201ceveryone prefers Z\u201d. This is a fractal experience; there is self-similarity across scales. Issues that arise at one level of the system have weird echoes elsewhere. Indeed, one way of discriminating among options (XML, HTML, Markdown, JSON, YAML, SAX, DOM, etc.) is to consider their different approaches to the problem of managing the chaos and representing (ir)regularity. This examination leads to a better understanding of how to exploit their differences to make them work better together."]
