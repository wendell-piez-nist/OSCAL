# `lib` directory

Libraries of transformations and utilities currently implemented in XML technologies: CSS, XSLT, XProc.

These are all works in progress and under active maintenance and development. As such they are likely to change. Some of them (such as CSS files) have general purposes; others (such as XSLT or XQuery) may have very narrow uses.

## `CSS`

CSS files to be used in conjunction with OSCAL XML in an editing or browsing application.

## `sketch` (experimental)

An XProc pipeline calling XSLT transformations to produce a graphical representation of an XML data structure. Under development.

## `util`

Miscellaneous utility transformations and queries.

## `XProc`

W3C XProc implementations of pipelined transformations may be found here. Currently, only a resolve-and-render pipeline is given, for testing profile resolution.

## `XSLT`

XSLT transformations. Several subdirectories of stylesheets for various purposes.
